MANDATE FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION Background  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine with the chemical name ‘3-(2,5-diaminophenyl)propan-1-ol’ and its dihydrochloride salt with the chemical name ‘3-(2,5-diaminophenyl)propan-1-ol dihydrochloride salt’ (CAS/EC No. 73793-79-0/827-723-1 and 1928659-47-5/-, respectively) are considered cosmetic ingredients with the reported functions of hair dyeing. Currently, they are not regulated under the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009. In 2018, Commission services received a dossier from industry to support the safe use of Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt (A165) as a hair dye in cosmetic products. In its corresponding Opinion, SCCS/1608/19, the SCCS concluded that ‘In light of the data provided, the SCCS considers that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt are not safe when used in oxidative hair colouring products due to potential genotoxicity’. In addition, the SCCS noted that ‘A mild to moderate eye irritation potential of the test item cannot be excluded’.  With submission II, received in June 2022, the applicant provided additional data in order to address the issue of genotoxicity and requests to re-assess the safety of p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt (A165) intended to be used in oxidative hair colouring products up to a maximum on-head concentration of 2 %.   Terms of reference  1. In light of the data provided, does the SCCS consider Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt safe when used in oxidative hair colouring products up to a maximum on-head concentration of 2 %? 2. Does the SCCS have any further scientific concerns with regard to the use of Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt in cosmetic products?  2.

Analytical certificate version 2: According to the Applicant, this new analysis certificate is issued to check the stability of the compound. Storage conditions: Ambient temperature, under inert gas, away from light and shielded from humidity. The compound is considered to be stable when stored in the appropriate aforementioned conditions.  Ref: Amsellem, 2014  During the public consultation period the Applicant provided clarification on the storage conditions. The salt form of A165 (R0025521B batch 004 P 001) has been initially stored at room temperature (20-25°C) according to the certificate of analysis version 2 (edited in 2013) and version 3 (edited in 2015). Giving that this batch remained stable between 2013 and 2015, this confirms the stability of A165 when stored at room temperature. A stability study conducted in 2016 showed that A165 is stable at 4°C for more than two months. Furthermore, the Applicant explored the stability of A165 under more stringent conditions like high temperature reaching 45°C., however degradation was observed at 45°C after a period of one month. Thus, as a precautionary measure, the Applicant recommends storing A165 at 4°C, and this was reported in the version 4 of the certificates of analysis in 2016.  SCCS comment Detailed data on the stability of test substance in formulations should be provided by HPLC-PDA analysis over the wavelength range (200-400 nm).           3.2 TOXICOKINETIC 3.2.1 Dermal / percutaneous absorption  From previous Opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  The dermal absorption of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was estimated to be 3.7 μg/cm2 (mean + 1SD). 3.2.2 Other studies on toxicokinetics /  3.3 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT  3.3.1 Function and uses  From previous opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  The ingredients hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt (A165) are intended to be used in oxidative hair colouring products at on-head concentrations up to 2%.  According to the Applicant, hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine is a weak base, and as such may be formulated in the chemical form of a pure base, or as the salt of a simple inorganic counter-anion such as dihydrochloride. The salt form may be used in order to improve stability, solubility or to facilitate the formulation of the respective base. Choosing for a hair dye ingredient either the salt or free base form is linked to the ease and stability under storage conditions of these raw materials. When formulated in finished oxidative hair coloring products, these two chemical forms of the hair dye ingredient A165 (free base and dihydrochloride salt) are quantitatively present as they are or converted to the free base. This is a consequence of the high pH value of oxidative hair coloring products (typically of about 9-10), which is significantly higher than the pKa values of hydroxypropyl phenylenediamine (2.9 and 6.1 for each of the two amine functions of A165). Accordingly, only hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (free base) is present in oxidative hair coloring products containing the hair dye ingredient A165, regardless of which initial form (salt or free base) of the ingredient is used to formulate the product.  3.3.2 Calculation of SED/LED /          3.4 TOXICOLOGICAL EVALUATION  3.4.1. Irritation and corrosivity  3.4.1.1 Skin irritation  From previous Opinion (SCCS/1608/19) Even though hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl diluted to 2% w/w in water has a very low pH=2 which may lead to corrosive effects, skin irritation was not detected in the in vitro Episkin study. However, the observed increase in ear thickness up to 20% in the LLNA indicates that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl is slightly irritant to the skin.   3.4.1.2 Mucous membrane irritation / eye irritation  From previous opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was tested in the BCOP assay, an in vitro method that can be used to identify ocular corrosive and severe irritants, but not mild irritants. Even though hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl diluted to 2% w/w in water has a very low pH (pH=2) which may lead to corrosive effects, the BCOP assay did not indicate severe eye irritation. This, however, does not exclude mild or moderate eye irritancy potential. Under the conditions of this study, a mild to moderate eye irritation potential of the test item cannot be excluded.  3.4.2 Skin sensitisation  From previous Opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  The SCCS agrees with the Applicant that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl is a moderate skin sensitiser. The Applicant stated that there was no noteworthy increase in ear thickness, but this is not supported by the provided data that show an increase in ear thickness in all exposed mice. In the high-dose group an increase of 20% in ear thickness was reported. In view of this, the SCCS considers hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl as slightly irritant under the conditions of this study.  3.4.3 Acute toxicity  3.4.3.1 Acute oral toxicity  The 14-day oral repeated dose toxicity study provides evidence that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl caused mortality at dose levels of 300 and 1000 mg/kg. This study indicates that the LD50 is above 300 mg/kg.  3.4.3.2 Acute dermal toxicity  /  3.4.3.3 Acute inhalation toxicity  / 3.4.4 Repeated dose toxicity  From previous Opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  The 14-day oral repeated dose toxicity study provides evidence that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl caused mortality at dose levels of 300 and 1000 mg/kg. This study indicates that the LD50 is above 300 mg/kg.  A NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was identified in the 14-day oral repeated dose toxicity study. This NOAEL is based on statistically significant decreases in red blood cell count, hematocrit and prothrombin that were time-observed in females at 300 mg/kg bw/d. In addition, a trend increase in absolute and relative liver and kidney organ weights was observed. These changes were significant at 300 mg/kg/day.  A NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was established in the 90-day repeated dose toxicity studies. The SCCS considers the statistically significant effects in some clinical chemistry parameters as well as the statistically significant increase in relative liver weights of females at the high dose as adverse and of toxicological relevance. Hall et al (2012) suggest that in the absence of histological changes a weight-of evidence approach should be used by considering biologically significant and consistent increase in at least two further liver parameters. Since both ALT and AST levels were statistically significantly increased in the high-dose females compared to controls, the SCCS considers the liver effects as adverse, resulting in a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day.   3.4.4.1 Repeated dose (28 days) oral / dermal / inhalation toxicity  /  3.4.4.2 Sub-chronic (90 days) oral / dermal / inhalation toxicity  /  3.4.4.3 Chronic (> 12 months) toxicity  / 3.4.5 Reproductive toxicity  3.4.5.1 Fertility and reproduction toxicity  / 3.4.5.2 Developmental Toxicity  From previous Opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  The SCCS agrees that Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl does not need to be considered as a teratogen. At 100 and 30 mg/kg/day, Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl caused a decrease of maternal body weight gain, a decrease of absolute and relative uterus weight and in the number of implants. At both doses a statistically significant increase of pre-implantation loss was observed. Since dosing with A165 started only after the implantation period, the observed changes in pre-implantation loss and absolute and relative uterus weight are not related to the administration of A165. At 30 mg/kg/day, a trend of decreased maternal body weight gain and a decreased of number of live foetuses. These trends of decreased maternal body weight gain and decreased number of live foetuses were directly related to the slight apparent increase in post-implantation loss rate. The SCCS agrees with the Applicant that the latter was related to a single dam out of 20 with a very high loss rate and that this animal should be considered as an outlier. After excluding this dam, there was no difference in post implantation rate at 30 mg/kg/day compared to the control group. In the light of the further information provided, the SCCS agrees with the Applicant that the NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl was 30 mg/kg/day.  3.4.6 Mutagenicity / genotoxicity  The safety profile of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt was evaluated by SCCS in 2019 (SCCS/1608/19 Final Opinion). At that time, the SCCS concluded that “hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt are not safe when used in oxidative hair colouring products due to potential genotoxicity”.  SCCS overall comment on mutagenicity (SCCS/1608/19 Final Opinion) Mutagenicity of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base) and its dihydrochloride salt was investigated in in vitro genotoxicity tests for the 3 endpoints of genotoxicity: gene mutations, structural and numerical chromosome aberrations. Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base) was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation test and the in vitro micronucleus test in cultured human lymphocytes.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation test, two mammalian cell gene mutation tests in mouse lymphoma cells (Hprt locus) and a micronucleus assay in cultured human lymphocytes.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was tested in the mammalian in vivo micronucleus test integrated into a 14-day repeated oral toxicity study as well. The base form was not tested in vivo. The Table below summarises the results of the genotoxicity tests.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base) was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test, but positive in the in vitro micronucleus assay and is considered to be an in vitro mutagen. Based on the data provided, a mutagenic potential cannot be excluded for the base form.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was positive in the bacterial reverse mutation test and the in vitro micronucleus test. The in vivo micronucleus assay was negative and provides sufficient evidence that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl does not induce chromosomal damage and clastogenicity and is not genotoxic in vivo.  The in vitro mammalian gene mutation test was considered to be inconclusive by the SCCS due to several experimental limitations, including high variability in mutant frequency of positive control NQO between the experiments, a high variation in MF for NQO historical positive control and different negative historical control ranges reported for Experiment 1 and 2. The additional mammalian gene mutation test submitted by the Applicant was again unacceptable. Therefore, neither of these mammalian gene mutation studies can be used to exclude a gene mutation potential. In the absence of a valid mammalian gene mutation test, the SCCS cannot exclude a genotoxic potential of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine.   Table 10. Summary of the genotoxicity data in Opinion on Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt (A165) (SCCS/1608/19 Final Opinion).     In the present Opinion the following studies have been submitted: the reconstructed skin micronucleus assay (RSMN) with the base form, in vitro alkaline Comet assay in reconstructed 3D full thickness human skin model with the dihydrochloride form, and ToxTracker with both forms. The Applicant submitted analytical dossier.  Additionally, a new mammalian gene mutation test was submitted upon request from the SCCS on Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl, because in the absence of a valid mammalian gene mutation test, the SCCS could not exclude a genotoxic potential of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine’.   3.4.6.1 Mutagenicity / genotoxicity in vitro   Newly submitted genotoxicity studies  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base form)  In Vitro Micronucleus Test using Reconstructed skin Micronucleus (RSMN) assay in EpiDermTM  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of the test article R0025521A, by assessing induction of micronuclei in the reconstructed skin micronucleus assay (RSMN) in EpiDermTM  Test Material Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (commercial name IMEXINE OBN) batch 20031802 (HPLC purity 99.8%) was used in this study.  Test System EpiDermTM tissue from the MatTek Corporation (Ashland, MA, USA) was used in this experiment. The EpiDermTM model is a multilayered, differentiated tissue consisting of basal, spinous, granular and cornified layers resembling the normal human epidermis. This system has been demonstrated to be sensitive to the clastogenic and aneugenic activity of variety of chemicals.   Figure 1: Sectional view of 3D skin tissue showing intact multilayer of skin and basal layer of actively dividing keratinocytes (for details refer Curren et al., 2006).   Test Procedure Tissues were treated by application of 10 μL of the test article/vehicle mixture at the appropriate concentration on the top surface of the EpiDermTM tissue. In the preliminary cytotoxicity and the definitive micronucleus assays, EpiDermTM tissues were treated twice, 24 hours apart and tissues were processed at 48 hours (2-day dosing regimen). In the confirmatory micronucleus assay, the tissues were treated three times, 24 hours apart and tissues were processed at 72 hours (3-day dosing regimen).  The preliminary cytotoxicity test was conducted by exposing a single tissue per concentration to vehicle alone and 15 concentrations of the test article ranging from 0.006 to 100 mg/mL.  Based on these results, the definitive micronucleus assay was conducted using triplicate tissues at 6 concentrations of the test article ranging from 0.031 to 25.5 mg/mL. In the definitive micronucleus assay, ≥ 50% cytotoxicity by calculating CBPI and RVCC relative to vehicle control was observed at the concentrations of ≥ 12.5 mg/mL. Precipitate was observed on the tissue at concentrations ≥ 6.25 mg/mL at the end of second treatment. The concentrations selected for scoring micronuclei were 0.313, 3.13, and 6.25 mg/mL  One thousand binucleated cells per tissue were scored for the presence of micronuclei.  Since the result of the micronucleus assay using a 2-day dosing regimen was negative, a confirmatory assay was conducted with a 3-day dosing regimen at concentrations ranging from 0.016 to 12.5 mg/mL using triplicate tissues. The highest dose evaluated for micronuclei was selected based on visible precipitate observed on the tissue at concentrations ≥ 3.13 mg/mL at the end of the third treatment.  The concentrations selected for scoring micronuclei were 0.031, 0.313, and 3.13 mg/mL. The slides were stained with acridine orange. A minimum of 1000 binucleated cells with intact and red-stained cytoplasm were analysed per tissue.  Cytotoxicity was determined for each model by calculating the cytokinesis-blocked proliferation index (CBPI) and by the relative viable cell count (RVCC). Negative (Acetone) and positive controls (Mitomycin C MMC, Carbendazim CBZ, Cyclophosphamide CP) were run in parallel. Test article dilutions were prepared immediately before use and delivered to the test system at room temperature under filtered light. The study was conducted under GLP. Results In the definitive micronucleus assay, the percentage of micronucleated binucleated cells in the vehicle control was within the acceptable historical control range and the percentage of micronucleated binucleated cells in the positive control was statistically increased and within the historical positive range.  The percentage of cells with micronucleated binucleated cells in the test article-treated tissues was not significantly increased relative to the vehicle control at any concentration, and no significant dose response trend was observed. The percentage of micronucleated cells in the MMC and CBZ was statistically significant relative to the vehicle control. In the confirmatory micronucleus assay, the percentage of micronucleated binucleated cells in the vehicle control was within the acceptable historical control range and the percentage of micronucleated binucleated cells in the positive control was statistically increased and within the historical positive range.  The percentage of cells with micronucleated binucleated cells in the test article-treated tissues was not significantly increased relative to the vehicle control at any concentration, and no significant dose response trend was observed. The percentage of micronucleated cells in the CBZ and CP was statistically significant relative to the vehicle control.  Table 11.

Summary of the results from micronucleus assay (confirmatory assay): Evaluation in EpiDermTM 3D skin treated with R0025521A    Conclusion Under the conditions of the study, hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine was concluded to be negative for the induction of micronuclei in the reconstructed skin micronucleus assay (RSMN) in EpiDermTM. Roy, 2020  SCCS comment The SCCS acknowledges that the Reconstructed skin Micronucleus (RSMN) assay is a promising test to be used as second tier assay to follow-up on positive results from standard in vitro assays for dermally applied compounds even if RSMN is not adopted yet as an OECD TG. The SCCS agrees that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine is negative for the induction of micronuclei in this assay.   ToxTracker®  ToxTracker® is a newly developed test that explores mechanistic insight on genotoxicity and can accurately classify compounds as genotoxic or non-genotoxic. ToxTracker is a panel of mammalian stem cell lines that contain different fluorescent reporters for induction of DNA damage, oxidative stress, and protein damage. The test substance was analysed in absence and presence of an S9 rat liver extract-based metabolising system. Although the experiments were conducted as a non-GLP study, general principles to conduct proper scientifically correct in vitro experiments were adhered to. For all ToxTracker analyses, test facility strictly followed the OECD Good Cell Culture Practice guidelines.  Test Materials Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine batch 001L002 were used in this study.  Test System The ToxTracker assay is a panel of six validated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based mouse embryonic stem (mES) reporter cell lines representing four distinct biological responses that are associated with carcinogenesis, i.e., general cellular stress, DNA damage, oxidative stress and the unfolded protein response. The induction of GFP reporters by test compounds is efficiently measured across a broad concentration range using flow cytometry, resulting in quantitative data on dose-response relationships.  In contrast to the cancer-derived cell lines that are currently used for in vitro genotoxicity testing, stem cells are genetically stable and proficient in all cellular pathways required for accurate detection of potentially carcinogenic properties of compounds. Extensive whole-genome transcription profiling has led to identification of a panel of biomarker genes that are preferentially activated upon exposure to different classes of carcinogens and toxicants.  The ToxTracker assay contains two reporters for genotoxicity: Bscl2-GFP, which is activated upon formation of bulky DNA lesions and subsequent DNA replication stress and Rtkn-GFP, which is activated upon induction of DNA double strand breaks.  ToxTracker is a mammalian stem cell-based assay that monitors activation of specific cellular signaling pathways for detection of the biological reactivity of compounds.     Figure 2: Biological endpoints detected by ToxTracker assay   Test Procedure Cytotoxicity testing/dose range finding. For chemical testing, first a dose range finding was performed using wild-type mES cells (strain B4418). Wild-type mES cells were exposed to 20 different concentrations of the test substances, with a maximum concentration of 10 mM. Cytotoxicity was estimated by cell count after 24 h exposure using a flow cytometer and was expressed as the percentage of viable cells after 24 h exposure compared to vehicle control exposed cells. From this dose range finding, 5 concentrations were selected.  The six independent mES reporter cell lines were seeded in gelatin-coated 96-well cell culture plates in 200 μl mES cell medium (50000 cells per well). 24 h after seeding the cells in the 96-well plates, medium was aspirated and fresh mES cell medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and the diluted chemicals were added to the cells. For the tested materials, five concentrations were tested in 2-fold dilutions. Induction of the GFP reporters was determined after 24 h exposure using a flow cytometer. Only GFP expression in intact single cells was determined. Mean GFP fluorescence was measured and used to calculate GFP reporter induction compared to a vehicle control treatment.  Cytotoxicity was estimated by cell count after 24 h exposure using a flow cytometer and was expressed as percentage of intact cells after 24 h exposure compared to vehicle exposed controls. For cytotoxicity assessment in the ToxTracker assay, the relative cell survival for the six different reporter cell lines was averaged, because the cytotoxicity levels were very similar. Metabolic activation was included in the ToxTracker assay by addition of S9 liver extract from aroclor 1254- induced rats (Moltox). Cells were exposed to five concentrations of the test samples in the presence of 0.25% S9 and required co-factors (RegenSysA+B, Moltox) for 24 h. In case auto-fluorescence of the test substances was observed in the dose range finding, wild-type mES cells were exposed to the test samples at the same concentrations as used in the ToxTracker assay. The mean fluorescence caused by the sample was then subtracted from the ToxTracker results of the sample.  Positive reference treatments with cisplatin (DNA damage), diethyl maleate (oxidative stress), tunicamycin (unfolded protein response) and aflatoxin B1 (metabolic activation of progenotoxins by S9) were included in all experiments.  Criteria The ToxTracker assay was considered to have a positive response when a compound induces at least a 2-fold increase in GFP expression in any of the reporters. Activation of the Bscl2-GFP or Rtkn-GFP reporters indicate induction of DNA damage, Srxn1-GFP and Blvrb-GFP indicate induction of cellular oxidative stress and Ddit3-GFP activation is associated with the unfolded protein response. The Btg2-GFP reporter is controlled by the p53 tumour suppressor and is activated by DNA damage but can also be induced by oxidative stress, hypoxia, metabolic stress and apoptosis.  Results on Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine • Limited cytotoxicity (~25%) was observed at the maximum tested concentration of 1250 μM in the absence of a metabolising system. A small decrease in cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of a metabolising system. The maximum test concentration was limited due to precipitation in the cell culture medium after 24 h of treatment. • Weak (>1.5-fold) activation of the Bscl2-GFP genotoxicity reporter was observed in absence of a metabolising system, but the 2-fold threshold for a positive ToxTracker was not reached. • Activation of the p53 response in absence of a metabolising system was observed. • Activation of the oxidative stress reporters was observed in the ToxTracker assay in the absence and presence of a metabolising system. • Activation of the unfolded protein response was observed in absence and presence of S9.    Conclusion Under the conditions of this study, hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine was classified as non-genotoxic in the ToxTracker assay since no activation of more than 2-fold of the Bscl2-GFP or Rtkn-GFP reporter was observed. Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine activated the p53 response, oxidative stress and proteins stress reporters. Derr and Brandsma, 2021  SCCS comment ToxTracker assay is validated but has not been adopted yet as an OECD TG.

Tissue has well developed epidermis and dermis layer and fully functional barrier layer that mimic the native human skin.  Two valid main experiments were performed. Prior to the main experiments, a dose range finding study was performed to select suitable dose levels for the comet assay. Tissues were treated for three times (0, 24, and 45 hours ± 30 min). In the confirmatory trial of the Comet assay, aphidicolin (APC) was added to the culture 4 hours ± 15 minutes prior to harvest. In the preliminary cytotoxicity test for selection of dose levels, tissues were exposed to vehicle alone (ethanol in water 70:30) and to 11 concentrations of test article with half dose spacing. One tissue was used per concentration. The test article was evaluated at a maximum concentration of 1600 μg/cm². In the definitive Comet assay, the concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, 25 and 50 μg/cm² of test article were tested using triplicate tissues based on the cytotoxicity profile. A first confirmatory assay, where the positive control for the dermis did not meet assay criteria, and a repeat confirmatory assay were conducted at concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 μg/cm². The highest dose evaluated for comets following a 3-day dosing regimen was selected based on visible precipitate observed on top of the tissue at the end of the last treatment. Negative (Ethanol in water 70:30) and positive controls (methyl methane sulfonate MMS and benzo[a]pyrene B[a]P in the definitive and confirmatory/repeat-confirmatory experiments, respectively) were run in parallel. Test article dilutions were prepared immediately before use and delivered to the test system at room temperature under filtered light.  Cytotoxicity was determined in each experiment based on measurement of adenylate kinase (AK) activity and intracellular Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) concentration. Coded duplicate comet assay slides per skin membrane were evaluated (50 cells per slide) for both epidermal and dermal cells using the fluorescent dye SYBR Gold to determine the genotoxic potential.  The following endpoints of DNA damage were assessed and measured: • Comet Tail Migration: defined as the distance from the perimeter of the Comet head to the last visible point in the tail. • % Tail DNA (also known as % tail intensity or % DNA in tail): defined as the percentage of DNA present in the tail. • Tail Moment: defined as the product of the amount of DNA in the tail and the tail length [(% Tail DNA x Tail Length)/100]  The study was conducted under GLP.  Results In the definitive Comet assay, post-treatment cytotoxicity [≥ 2-fold increase in adenylate kinase activity or ≥ 50% reduction in ATP/protein ratio relative to the vehicle control] was not observed at any concentration. At the end of the third treatment, visible precipitate was observed on top of the tissue at concentrations ≥ 15 μg/cm².  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl gave a negative (non-DNA damaging) response in this assay in the dermis and epidermis of the Reconstructed 3D Human Skin Model. None of the test article-treated multi-well slides showed significant increases in the % Tail DNA compared to the vehicle control in the epidermis. Test article treated multi-well slides at 2 μg/cm² showed a significant decrease in the % Tail DNA compared to the vehicle control in the dermis. However, this decrease was within historical control limits and not dose-related. Therefore, this decrease was not considered biologically relevant. The arithmetic mean of the solvent control did not exceed 20% tail intensity in either the dermis and epidermis, and the positive control induced at least a 2-fold increase in % tail intensity and an absolute difference of at least 15% (MMS) compared to the vehicle control in both the dermis and epidermis.  Since the result of the definitive Comet assay was negative, a confirmatory Comet assay was conducted. In the initial confirmatory Comet assay, post-treatment cytotoxicity was not observed at any concentration. At the end of the third treatment, visible precipitate was observed on top of the tissue at concentrations ≥ 10 μg/cm².  The test article gave a negative (non-DNA damaging) response in this assay in the epidermis of the Reconstructed 3D Human Skin Model. However, the positive control for the dermis did not meet assay criteria. Therefore, the confirmatory assay was repeated with the same concentrations as in the initial confirmatory assay. In the repeat confirmatory Comet assay, post-treatment cytotoxicity was not observed at any concentration. At the end of the third treatment, visible precipitate was observed on top of the tissue at concentrations ≥ 15 μg/cm².  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl gave a negative (non-DNA damaging) response in this assay in the dermis and epidermis of the Reconstructed 3D Human Skin Model. None of the test article-treated multi-well slides showed significant increases in the % Tail DNA compared to the vehicle control in the dermis and epidermis. The arithmetic mean of the solvent control did not exceed 20% tail intensity in either the dermis and epidermis, and the positive control induced at least a 2-fold increase in % tail intensity and an absolute difference of at least 5% (B[a]P + APC) compared to the vehicle control in both the dermis and epidermis.       Table 13. Summary of the definitive comet assay results in 3D human skin model.     Conclusion Under the conditions of the study, hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl did not cause a significant increase in DNA damage in the dermis and epidermis of Reconstructed 3D Human Skin Models relative to the concurrent vehicle control. Therefore, hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl was concluded to be negative in the in vitro 3D Skin Comet Assay.  Roy, 2021  SCCS comment The in vitro comet assay on 3D-skin model is validated but has not been adopted yet as OECD TG.

Treatments were carried out for 5 hours with and without metabolic activation (±S9-mix). The design of this study was based on the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 440/2008 and OECD No. 476 guideline, and the study was performed in compliance with Charles River Laboratories Hungary Kft. standard operating procedures and with the OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice. Distilled water was used as the vehicle (solvent) of the test item in this study. Treatment concentrations for the mutation assays of the main tests were selected based on the results of a preliminary toxicity test as follows:  Assay 1 repeated 5-hour treatment in the presence of S9-mix: 2000, 1800, 1600, 1500, 1400, 1200, 1000, 500, 250 and 125 μg/mL.  Assay 1 5-hour treatment in the absence of S9-mix: 2000, 1000, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 200, 100 and 50 μg/mL.  Assay 2 5-hour treatment in the presence of S9-mix: 2000, 1800, 1600, 1500, 1400, 1200, 1000, 500, 250 and 125 μg/mL. 5-hour treatment in the absence of S9-mix: 2000, 1000, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 200, 100 and 50 μg/mL.  In Assay 1 (repeated) insolubility was detected in the final treatment medium at the end of the treatment in the experiments with metabolic activation at the concentration range of 2000 – 1200 μg/mL. There were no large changes in pH and osmolality after treatment in any cases.  In Assay 1 (repeated), in the presence of S9-mix (5-hour treatment), cytotoxicity of the test item was observed (1600, 1500 and 1400 μg/mL concentrations showed, with a relative survival of 12%, 44% and 68%, respectively). An evaluation was made using data of eight of the lower concentrations based on the acceptable cytotoxicity data. Statistically significant increase in the mutation frequencies were observed in this experiment at the concentrations of 1500 μg/mL, 1400 μg/mL and 500 μg/mL at p < 0.01 level; and at the concentrations of 1200 μg/mL and 125 μg/mL at p < 0.05 level, although the observed values were within the local, general historical control range. Furthermore, the observed mutant frequencies (11.6, 8.4, 8.8, 10.5 and 8.9 x 10- 6) were within the expected range of the negative control samples according to the relevant OECD guideline (expected range: 5-20 x 10-6). No dose response to the treatment was observed (a trend analysis showed no effect of treatment (R2 = 0.045)). In this assay, precipitation was observed from 1200-1400 μg/mL, so in theory any higher concentrations can be excluded according to the guideline; however, the interpretation for this assay is identical. This experiment is considered to be negative.  In Assay 1, in the absence of S9-mix (5-hour treatment), cytotoxicity of the test item was observed 800, 700, 600 and 500 μg/mL concentrations showed, with a relative survival of 12%, 23%, 30% and 42%, respectively). An evaluation was made using data of eight of the lower concentrations based on the acceptable cytotoxicity data. A statistically significant increase in the mutation frequencies was observed in this experiment at the concentration of 500 μg/mL (at p < 0.05 level), although the observed values were within the general historical control range. Furthermore, the observed mutant frequencies (8.2 x 10-6) were within the expected range of the negative control samples according to the relevant OECD guideline (expected range: 5-20 x 10-6). A slight dose response was indicated by the linear trend analysis because all concentrations were within the expected range, it was not considered to be relevant (R2 = 0.890). This experiment is considered to be negative.  In Assay 2, a 5-hour treatment with metabolic activation (in the presence of S9-mix) and a 5-hour treatment without metabolic activation (in the absence of S9-mix) were performed. For the 5-hour treatment in the presence of S9-mix, the following concentrations were examined: 2000, 1800, 1600, 1500, 1400, 1200, 1000, 500, 250 and 125 μg/mL. For the 5-hour treatment in the absence of S9-mix, the following concentrations were examined: 2000, 1000, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 200, 100 and 50 μg/mL. In Assay 2, insolubility (precipitation) was detected in the final treatment medium at the end of the treatment in the experiment with metabolic activation at the concentration range of 2000 – 1400 μg/mL. Also, an indication of possible insolubility was seen at 500 – 250 μg/mL as an oily film; but since higher concentrations showed no evidence of insolubility, these observations were not considered to be relevant to study interpretation. There were no large changes in pH and osmolality after treatment in any cases.  In the presence of S9-mix (5-hour treatment), cytotoxicity of the test item was observed (1600, 1500 and 1400 μg/mL concentrations showed, with a relative survival of 9%, 28% and 64%, respectively). An evaluation was made using data of eight of the lower concentrations based on the acceptable cytotoxicity data. A statistically significant increase in the mutation frequencies (at p < 0.05 level) was observed in this experiment at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL, although the observed values were within the local, general historical control range. Furthermore, the observed mutant frequency (12.8 x 10-6) was within the expected range of the negative control samples according to the relevant OECD guideline (expected range: 5-20 x 10-6). No dose response to the treatment was observed (a trend analysis showed no effect of treatment (R2 = 0.037)). In this assay, precipitation was observed from 1600 μg/mL, so in theory any higher concentrations can be excluded according to the guideline; however, the interpretation for this assay is identical. This experiment is considered to be negative. Moreover, it confirmed the result of the Assay 1.  In the absence of S9-mix (5-hour treatment), cytotoxicity of the test item was observed (800, 700, 600, 500 and 400 μg/mL concentrations showed, with a relative survival of 8%, 18%, 23%, 39% and 57%, respectively). An evaluation was made using data of eight of the lower concentrations based on the acceptable cytotoxicity data. A statistically significant increase in the mutant frequencies (at p < 0.01 level) was observed in this experiment at the concentration of 800 μg/mL and 400 μg/mL, although the observed values were within the general historical control range. Furthermore, the observed mutant frequency (14.1 and 18.5 x 10-6) was within the expected range of the negative control samples according to the relevant OECD guideline (expected range: 5- 20 x 10- 6). No dose response to the treatment was observed (a trend analysis showed no effect of treatment (R2 = 0.431)). This experiment is considered to be negative.  The spontaneous mutant frequency of the negative (vehicle) control was in accordance with the general historical control range in all assays. The positive controls gave the anticipated increases in mutant frequency over the controls and were very much in line with the historical data in all assays. Eight evaluated concentrations were presented in all assays. The cloning efficiencies for the negative controls at the beginning and end of the expression period were within the target range. The evaluated concentration ranges were considered to be adequate (concentrations were tested up to the maximum recommended concentrations or cytotoxic range in each test). The overall study was considered to be valid.  In conclusion, no mutagenic effect of R0025521B was observed either in the presence or absence of a metabolic activation system under the conditions of this HPRT assay. The study was considered valid based on the negative and positive control values. Nagy, 2023  SCCS comments The SCCS agrees that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl is negative in the mammalian gene mutation test. The SCCS has following comments:  • In the presence of S9 mix a significant increase in mutant frequency was detected in 5 concentrations in assay 1 and in 1 concentration in assay 2. However, most of values were in the range of historical control or very slightly above but within recommended level of spontaneous mutant frequency (5-20x106). No concentration response was found. • In the absence of S9 mix significant increase in mutant frequency was observed in one concentration in both assays which was above the range of historical control (18.5x106 vs 4.7x106 in assay 2) but within recommended level of spontaneous mutant frequency (5-20x106). No concentration response was found. • Precipitation (insolubility) occurred in concentration 500μg/ml and above in the absence of metabolic activation and in concentrations 1600μg/ml and above in the presence of S9mix. • High variability in negative and positive historical control values (high standard deviation, difference in min and max) was observed (in spontaneous mutant frequency almost 20x difference), for positive controls 5-15x difference).    Summary of all results and overall SCCS comment on mutagenicity/genotoxicity of Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine base and salt:   Table 14. Summary of all results from submission I and II:   The Applicant used a battery of assays to test genotoxicity of Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine base and its salt according to the SCCS Guidance for the testing of cosmetic ingredients and their safety evaluation (SCCS 1647/22) and the current state-of-knowledge.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine base was negative in the bacterial gene mutation test but positive in a standard micronucleus assay (from the SCCS/1608/19 Opinion Submission I). As follow up Micronucleus assay was performed on the Reconstructed skin. RSMN assay is a promising test to be used as second tier assay to follow-up on positive results from standard in vitro assays for dermally applied compounds even if RSMN is not adopted yet as an OECD TG. The SCCS agrees that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine base is negative for the induction of micronuclei in this assay. Additionally negative results on ToxTracker reporter gene assay based on stem cells support this finding in WoE approach.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl was positive in micronucleus in vitro but negative on in vivo micronucleus (previous opinion SCCS/1608/19) demonstrating no in vivo chromosomal damage. Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine HCl was also negative in a new mammalian gene mutation test under experimental conditions tested. Additionally, the comet assay results on reconstructed skin model and results on stem cells-based reporter genes assay (ToxTracker) were negative in the experimental conditions tested. The SCCS is of the opinion that Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine base and its salt do not induce gene mutations in mammalian cells nor structural or numerical chromosomal damage in experimental conditions tested up to precipitation concentrations.   3.4.6.2 Mutagenicity / genotoxicity in vivo  /  3.4.7 Carcinogenicity  From previous Opinion (SCCS/1608/19)  SCCS has noted the results of the CTA test.

The safety profile of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt has been evaluated by SCCS in 2019 (Opinion SCCS/1608/19). The SCCS concluded that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt are not safe when used in oxidative hair colouring products due to potential genotoxicity.  Complementary tests on both forms of A165 were performed in order to fulfill SCCS requests and further explore its genotoxicity profile. Accordingly, the following tests were conducted namely: For hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine base: • the reconstructed skin micronucleus assay (RSMN) • ToxTracker – to investigate the genotoxic mode-of-action  For hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride form: • the mammalian gene mutation test on CHO K1 Chinese hamster ovary cells at the Hprt locus, • in vitro alkaline Comet assay in reconstructed 3D full thickness human skin model with • ToxTracker to investigate the genotoxic mode-of-action Additionally new analytical data have been provided.  Physicochemical properties Impurities at content above 0.1% have been quantified using either external reference standards of the corresponding impurities or area normalisation. In the case of the known impurities where an external reference standard is used, the SCCS is of the opinion that a response factor should be applied for the quantitation. It should be demonstrated that the main compound and all the impurities are fully dissolved in the dilution solvent prior to the HPLC analysis. All impurities above 0.1% should be accurately quantified in every batch; effort should be made during the manufacturing procedure to keep these impurities at trace levels.  General toxicity The 14-day oral repeated dose toxicity study provides evidence that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl caused mortality at dose levels of 300 and 1000 mg/kg. This study indicates that the LD50 is above 300 mg/kg.  A NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was identified in the 14-day oral repeated dose toxicity study. This NOAEL is based on statistically significant decreases in red blood cell count, hematocrit and prothrombin that were time-observed in females at 300 mg/kg bw/d. In addition, a trend increase in absolute and relative liver and kidney organ weights was observed. These changes were significant at 300 mg/kg/day.  A NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was established in the 90-day repeated dose toxicity studies. The SCCS considers the statistically significant effects in some clinical chemistry parameters as well as the statistically significant increase in relative liver weights of females at the high dose as adverse and of toxicological relevance. Hall et al (2012) suggest that in the absence of histological changes a weight-of evidence approach should be used by considering biologically significant and consistent increase in at least two further liver parameters. Since both ALT and AST levels were statistically significantly increased in the high dose females compared to controls, the SCCS considers the liver effects as adverse, resulting in a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl is not considered as a teratogen. A NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day was established in the developmental toxicity study. At 100 and 30 mg/kg/day, Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl caused a decrease of maternal body weight gain, a decrease of absolute and relative uterus weight and in the number of implants. At both doses, a statistically significant increase of pre-implantation loss was observed. Since dosing with A165 started only after the implantation period, the observed changes in pre-implantation loss and absolute and relative uterus weight are not related to the administration of A165. The effects observed at 30 mg/kg/day were directly related to the slight apparent increase in post-implantation loss rate. The latter was related to a single dam out of 20 with a very high loss rate, which should be considered as an outlier. After excluding this dam, there was no difference in post implantation rate at 30 mg/kg/day compared to the control group.  Irritation/sensitisation Even though hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl diluted to 2% w/w in water has a very low pH=2 which may lead to corrosive effects, skin irritation was not detected in the in vitro Episkin study. However, the observed increase in ear thickness up to 20% in the LLNA, indicates that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl is slightly irritant to the skin. Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was tested in the BCOP assay, an in vitro method that can be used to identify ocular corrosive and severe irritants, but not mild irritants. Even though hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl diluted to 2% w/w in water has a very low pH (pH=2) which may lead to corrosive effects, the BCOP assay did not indicate severe eye irritation. This, however, does not exclude mild or moderate eye irritancy potential. Under the conditions of this study, a mild to moderate eye irritation potential of the test item cannot be excluded.    Dermal absorption The dermal absorption of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was estimated to be 3.7 μg/cm2 (mean + 1SD).  Mutagenicity / genotoxicity Mutagenicity of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base) and its dihydrochloride salt were investigated in in vitro genotoxicity tests for the 3 endpoints of genotoxicity: gene mutations, chromosome aberrations (clastogenicity) and aneugenicity.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base form) was non mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation test. It was positive in an in vitro micronucleus test in cultured human lymphocytes. This result can be considered not biologically relevant as it was not confirmed in a second-tier in vitro micronucleus test using EpiDermTM human reconstructed skin. In WoE hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine was investigated for the genotoxic mode-of-action using reporter genes Toxtracker assay with negative results. Thus, the SCCS considers hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (base form) neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride salt was mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation test. In vitro mammalian gene mutation tests were considered not reliable due to high variability between experiments. To further evaluate a mutagenic potential, new mammalian gene mutation test on CHO K1 Chinese hamster ovary cells at the Hprt locus was provided with negative results. Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was also negative in an in vitro alkaline Comet assay in the reconstructed 3D full thickness human skin model.  Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine 2HCl was positive in an in vitro micronucleus test. However, it did not induce cytogenetic damage leading to increased micronuclei formation in the bone marrow of rats treated orally in a 14-day repeated toxicity study up to the maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg bw.  Furthermore, the negative outcome of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride salt in ToxTracker can be used in a WoE approach to support the finding that the salt form of A165 is neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.  Based on the data provided, the SCCS considers both the base and the salt form of hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine to have no mutagenic/genotoxic potential.   4 CONCLUSION  The SCCS concludes the following:  1. In light of the data provided, does the SCCS consider Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt safe when used in oxidative hair colouring products up to a maximum on-head concentration of 2%? In light of the data provided, the SCCS considers that hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt are safe when used in oxidative hair colouring products up to a maximum on-head concentration of 2%.  2. Does the SCCS have any further scientific concerns with regard to the use of Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt in cosmetic products? A mild to moderate eye irritation potential of the test item cannot be excluded. Hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine and its dihydrochloride salt is a moderate skin sensitiser based on animal data.     5 MINORITY OPINION /   6 REFERENCES  Bonnet B (2022).
