1. ABSTRACT
The SCCS concludes the following:

(1)

In light of the data provided and taking under consideration the CMR Cat.2
classification (to be introduced in Annex VI to Reg. 1272/2008), does the SCCS
consider Hexyl Salicylate safe when used up to the maximum concentrations provided
in the dossier?
Based on the assessment of data provided and taking into consideration the concerns
related to potential endocrine disrupting properties, the SCCS considers Hexyl
Salicylate safe when used up to the maximum concentrations as provided in Table 1
of this Opinion.

(2)

0.001

Does the SCCS have any further scientific concerns with regard to the use of Hexyl
Salicylate in cosmetic products?
The Applicant did not provide any specific scenarios for children applying cosmetic
products on their skin (dermal exposure), nor were the differences between age
categories in some exposure parameters (body weight, amount of the products
applied, body surface, etc) taken into consideration. However, the SCCS notices that
in view of the high MoS for adults, far above 100, the MoS will also be above 100 for
children between 3 to 10, considering also the products categories used by children of
these ages.
The SCCS mandates do not address environmental aspects. Therefore, this
assessment did not cover the safety of Hexyl Salicylate for the environment.

About the Scientific Committees
Two independent non-food Scientific Committees provide the Commission with the scientific
advice it needs when preparing policy and proposals relating to consumer safety, public health
and the environment. The Committees also draw the Commission's attention to the new or
emerging problems which may pose an actual or potential threat.
These Committees are the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) and the Scientific
Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) and they are made up of
scientists appointed in their personal capacity.
In addition, the Commission relies upon the work of the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Centre for Disease prevention
and Control (ECDC) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
SCCS
The Committee shall provide Opinions on questions concerning health and safety risks
(notably chemical, biological, mechanical and other physical risks) of non-food consumer
products (for example cosmetic products and their ingredients, toys, textiles, clothing,
personal care and household products such as detergents, etc.) and services (for example:
tattooing, artificial sun tanning, etc.).

Opinion on Hexyl Salicylate (CAS/EC No. 6259-76-3/228-408-6)
_________________________________________________________________________________

2. MANDATE FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
Background
Hexyl Salicylate (CAS/EC No. 6259-76-3/228-408-6) is the INCI name of âhexyl 2hydroxybenzoateâ, an ingredient with sweet, floral, and fruity odour used in formulations of
fragrances in multiple consumer goods including cosmetic, household cleaning products,
detergents, and air care products.
Hexyl Salicylate is not listed in the Annexes to the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009
and its use is not otherwise restricted in cosmetic products.
The European Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) of ECHA issued in March 2022 an opinion 1
recommending a âToxic for Reproduction Category 2â (i.e., suspected of damaging the unborn
child) and âSkin sensitizer Category 1â classification for Hexyl Salicylate. These classifications
were based on the results of an LLNA assay and on âread acrossâ from the structural analogue
Methyl Salicylate and the metabolite Salicylic Acid, respectively.
Hexyl Salicylate is the ester of 1-hexanol and Salicylic Acid, with the latter being the main
metabolite. Salicylic Acid has been subject to a safety evaluation by SCCNFP in 2002 2 and
SCCS in 20183 and the SCCS is currently re-evaluating its safety in view of endocrine
disrupting concerns. The scientific committee has concluded on the safety of Methyl Salicylate
in 20214.
Following the RAC opinion, it is expected that the European Commission will propose a
classification for Hexyl Salicylate as a âToxic for Reproduction Category 2â and âSkin sensitizer
Category 1â (CLP Regulation Annex VI).
In December 2022, stakeholders submitted a dossier to support the safe use of Hexyl
Salicylate according to Art. 15(1) Reg. 1223/2009 with specific concentration limits for various
product types (see Table 1). The Commission requests the SCCS to carry out a safety
assessment on Hexyl Salicylate in view of the information provided.

EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT & TOXICOKINETICS

3.2.1

Function and uses

Hexyl Salicylate (CAS 6259-76-3; EC No. 228-408-6) can be synthesised for use in a range
of manufactured goods including cosmetic products, household cleaning products, detergents
and air care products (Lapczynski et al. 2007).
3.2.1.1 Cosmetic uses
Hexyl Salicylate is used in the formulation of fragrances in cosmetics as it has a sweet, floral
and fruity odour. Hexyl Salicylate is used globally in a wide range of cosmetics (Lapczynski et
al., 2007; CIR 2019).
The EU Cosmetics Regulation (Annex III) does not list Hexyl Salicylate as a restricted
substance in cosmetics and personal care products.
EU companies in the Hexyl Salicylate Consortium surveyed the typical use concentrations of
Hexyl Salicylate in cosmetic products: the maximum use in fine fragrance products was up to
2%, with up to 0.5% in rinse off products and 0.3% in leave on products. A value of 0.001%
is nominally applied for prospective use in oral care products, though no current use was
reported by Consortium members. These % w/w use levels will be applied in the aggregate
exposure assessment in this cosmetics safety evaluation.
3.2.1.2 Other uses
Hexyl Salicylate is also used as a fragrance ingredient in household cleaning products,
detergents and air care products. A range of non-cosmetic consumer uses are included in the
EU
REACH
dossier
(https://echa.europa.eu/fr/registration-dossier/-/registereddossier/14766/3/1/6).

Table 2: Summary of method details from an OECD Guideline 428 in vitro human skin
absorption study for Hexyl Salicylate

An in vitro human skin absorption study for Hexyl Salicylate (CAS 6259-76-3) was conducted
following OECD TG 428 guidelines for 24 hours and according to the guidelines expected by
the SCCS (2021), except that the dose was in contact with the skin surface for 8 hours (as
might mimic worker exposures) and not 24 hours as requested for the general population.
Skin membrane integrity was assured by performing a tritiated water test. The results from
the OECD TG 428 study by Maas (2016) are summarised below in Table 3.
Table 3: Skin absorption results for Hexyl Salicylate as applied to human skin in vitro: Group
A = 100% neat liquid; Group B = 20% and Group C = 0.1% in solvent dipropylene glycol.
RF = receptor fluid.

Illustrative data from the tape strips from Group B in this experiment are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Distribution of [14C]-Hexyl Salicylate in tape strips at 24 hours (Group B â 20%
dose).
As can be seen in Table 3, the majority of the test material is rinsed from the skin surface
and removed in the first few tape strips at 24 hours. Very low amounts penetrated into
receptor fluid with the majority of the low-level absorbed dose remaining in the skin. The
degree of total skin absorption is low for Hexyl Salicylate which is supported by its lipophilic
nature.
The mean absorbed dose at 24 hours, as per SCCS Notes of Guidance (2021), which is
measured as the compound-related radioactivity present in the receptor fluid + receptor
compartment + epidermis + dermis, was 0.53 Â± 0.14% (100% solution), 3.04 Â± 1.43% (20
% solution) and 2.34 Â± 0.69% (0.1% solution) of the applied dose, respectively.
To be conservative, taking the highest of these mean values for Group B, 3.04% plus 1
standard deviation of 1.43%, this leads to a total measured skin absorption value in this study
of 4.47%.
Given that the dose was only on the skin for an 8-hour duration (to mimic worker exposure
conditions), a correction factor of 3 has been applied to yield a value of 13.4% skin absorption
to mimic the 24-hour use in a consumer safety assessment. This amount is based on
measured radioactivity and it was hypothesised that this goes on to be absorbed mainly as
salicylic acid following first pass skin metabolism by esterases; this was tested in the same
study as described below.
3.2.2.4 In vivo human skin absorption
No data available.

3.2.3 Other studies on toxicokinetics
3.2.3.1 Dermal Metabolism data
From previous reviews on salicylates (CIR, 2019), it is known that n-alkyl salicylates are
converted by skin esterases and systemically (liver) to salicylic acid as the main metabolite
with the corresponding alcohol, in this case 1-hexanol. Various salicylates may be converted
to salicylic acid at different kinetic rates and overall extent by the skin and systemically. The
amount of systemic salicylic acid produced in the body is a function of both the dermal
absorption of the salicylate across the stratum corneum and the extent of metabolic
conversion of the absorbed substance by esterases. Not all salicylates may be substrates for
the active site of the esterase enzymes. However, this can be tested in vitro.
In the same study by Maas (2016), dermal metabolism of Hexyl Salicylate was assessed using
fresh human skin in vitro. Human breast skin was provided by female Donor 1 (n=3) and
human abdomen skin by female Donor 2 (n=3). Upon arrival at the laboratory, subcutaneous
fat was removed from the skin. Skin membranes were cut to a target thickness of 0.3-0.4
mm using a Dermatome (25 mm, Nouvag GmbH, Germany). The thickness of all skin
membranes was measured with a digimatic micrometer (Mitutoyo Corporation, Japan). For
logistic reasons, the skin discs were stored overnight, epidermal side up, on a gauze tissue
slightly wetted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 2-10Â°C until washing and start of
exposure the following day. A two-compartment static diffusion cell system was used. 14CHexyl Salicylate was applied for 8 hours at 0.1% in dipropylene glycol. Approximately 15 Î¼L
of dose solution was applied to each 1.5 cm2 skin sample, approximately 10 Î¼l/cm2. 24 hours
later receptor fluid was collected as a single sample and skin samples were also stored at 18Â°C until processing and analysis. Radio high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was used to characterise and quantify Hexyl Salicylate and salicylic acid.
Analysis of the low level of radioactive substance that had penetrated into receptor fluid
showed almost no parent compound (<1%). Salicylic acid was present at >94% in donor 1
and at >92% in donor 2. Analysis of the skin extracts showed some parent compound present,
ranging from 5.73% to 10.70% in three replicates obtained from donor 1 and from 19.95%
to 37.36% in three replicates isolated from donor 2. Salicylic acid was present at >86% in
donor 1 and at >59.5% in donor 2. Hydrolysis of Hexyl Salicylate to salicylic acid was almost
complete when applying a dose of 0.1% at 10 Î¼l/cm 2 skin, therefore it will be assumed that
at the low doses applied to the skin, 100% of the Hexyl Salicylate applied to human skin could
be converted to salicylic acid via skin esterases within a period of 24 hours.
Dermal Systemic Availability - Conclusions from the Applicant:
The following generic statements regarding dermal absorption and metabolism are supported
by the current body of data:
â¢ There is good evidence that absorption of parent Hexyl Salicylate is low across human skin.
â¢ A conservative skin absorption value of 13.4%, using a mean of (3.04% +1SD) x a
correction factor of 3 to convert 8-hour worker exposure to 24-hour consumer exposure, will
be taken forward from the OECD guideline 428 study (Maas 2016) for this safety evaluation.
The plausibility of this skin absorption rate is supported by the good comparability with the
skin absorption value for benzyl salicylate of 10.5% derived from an OECD Test Guideline 428
study, both compounds sharing similar LogP and MW.
â¢ It is expected, also based on the evidence from methyl- and benzyl salicylate, that the
majority of the substance measured by total radioactivity is in the form of salicylic acid.

_________________________________________________________________________________

â¢ It is expected that subsequent phase 2 conjugation leads to effective clearance of salicylic
acid (SCCS Opinion 2018).
SCCS comment
A value of 13.4% (3.04% + 1SD corrected for 24 hours, as described in 3.2.2.3) was
calculated following a recent in vitro study using human skin that meets the basic criteria for
skin absorption in SCCS Notes of Guidance (2021). This value will be used for the calculation
of the MoS.
3.2.3.2 Oral ADME/kinetic data in animals or humans for salicylates
Salicylates are known to be well absorbed across the gut (Goodman & Gilman, 2006). There
are no specific quantitative in vivo studies available on the ADME properties and kinetics of
Hexyl Salicylate via the oral route in animals and humans, but oral absorption studies
conducted on a similar analogue methyl salicylate indicate a rapid and nearly complete
absorption following ingestion. As a result, for the assessment of potential effects of oral
exposures to the salicylates from their use as cosmetic ingredients, an oral bioavailability of
100% is assumed (Belsito et al., 2007). This is supported by the 2018 SCCS opinion on
salicylic acid, where a 100% oral absorption was previously used (SCCS, 2018).

Oral bioavailability

Davison et al. (1961) performed two studies in both rats and dogs for a similar substance,
methyl salicylate.
Rat â 300 mg/kg bw (body weight) methyl salicylate in 2 % methylcellulose was administered
by oral gavage as a single dose, to groups of 10 male Wistar rats (200-350g). Blood samples
were taken at 20 and 60 min after administration. Plasma and brain tissues were analysed
for the presence of methyl salicylate and free salicylate. Methyl salicylate was completely
hydrolysed within 20 min of a single oral dose. After 20 min, 217 and 8 mg/L free salicylate
were found in the plasma and brain, respectively. After 60 min, these values were 278 and
42 mg/L, respectively. Methyl salicylate values were negligible.
Dogs â 300 mg/kg bw methyl salicylate was administered as a capsule in fasting male dogs
weighing 12-15 kg. Blood was taken from the cephalic vein at 1 h and 4 h intervals, and the
plasma was analysed. Hydrolysis was ~95% complete at both time points.

Distribution

After absorption, salicylates and salicylic acid are distributed throughout most body tissues
and most transcellular fluids, primarily by pH dependent passive processes. Salicylates are
actively transported by a low-capacity, saturable system out of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
across the choroid plexus. Salicylates readily crosses the placental barrier. The plasma halflife for methyl salicylate is 2 to 3 h in low doses but may be as long as 15 to 30 h at high
therapeutic doses or when there is intoxication (Gilman et al., 1990) e.g. at high doses in
animal toxicity studies. The in vitro protein binding of methyl salicylate is assumed to be
around 86% based on a study in rats where the unbound fraction was found to be 14%
(Dancik et al., 2011). The plasma protein binding may be a major and important factor
determining the extent of placental transfer and possibly also the teratogenicity of highly
protein-bound drugs (Nau, 1986). The protein binding of acetyl salicylic acid is species
dependent. In rats the protein binding is lower (30%) as compared to monkeys (~70%) and
hence the placental transfer of free unbound salicylic acid is more from mother to fetus in
rats as compared to monkeys.

Excretion

Salicylates are excreted in the urine as free salicylic acid (10%), salicyluric acid (75%),
salicylic phenolic (10%) and acyl (5%) glucuronides, and gentisic acid (less than 1%).
However, excretion of free salicylate is extremely variable and depends upon both the dose
and the urinary pH (Gilman, 1990).
3.2.3.3 Oral bioavailability of 1-hexanol metabolite
Upon hydrolysis of Hexyl Salicylate, salicylic acid and 1-hexanol are formed in situ. It is
expected that the 1-hexanol will be absorbed rapidly across the gut and further metabolised
in the liver by aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes to the corresponding hexanal
and hexanoic acid metabolites. Endogenous Phase 2 metabolism in the body via the fatty acid
pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle will rapidly degrade 1-hexanol to carbon dioxide and its
metabolites; excretion will be complete within 24 hours.
Conclusion on Oral ADME data from the Applicant:
Hexyl Salicylate, like methyl salicylate and benzyl salicylate, is expected to be rapidly and
completely absorbed and metabolised, in both gut and liver tissue by first pass metabolism,
to salicylic acid and 1-hexanol following oral exposure in both rat and humans. With rapid
hydrolysis in the gut and liver, systemic exposure is primarily to salicylic acid and 1-hexanol,
which do not accumulate in the body, and are rapidly excreted. This means that any point of
departure from an oral toxicology study on either Hexyl Salicylate, salicylic acid or 1-hexanol
can be regarded as a systemic point of departure (PODsys).
SCCS comment
Based on the available data indicating rapid and complete absorption, the SCCS considers
that an absorption value by oral route of 100% can be used in the risk assessment.
This value is also supported by another study performed with Methyl Salicylate (Yamagata et
al., 1976). This study is summarised in the Harmonised Classification and Labelling Report on
Methyl Salicylate. See CLH report template (europa.eu)
3.2.3.4 Inhalation and absorption through the lung
There are no data on the extent of Hexyl Salicylate absorption in the lung. Based on the high
log Po/w and low water solubility it is expected that Hexyl Salicylate will be poorly absorbed
by the inhalation route. An assumption of 100% absorption is therefore very conservative.

3.2.4 Calculation of SED/LED
Exposure assessment is, by necessity, an iterative process that begins as simple as possible
and moves to more complexity, bringing in more data as and when available to refine the
assessment (Meek et al., 2011). Deterministic additive methods for calculating aggregate
exposure assume that everybody in the population uses all the products each day, and that
all of the products contain the chemical of interest at a fixed maximum concentration, which
is not a realistic scenario but is a simple place to start. This technique is the basis of the
current SCCS Notes of Guidance (2021) approach to aggregate exposure assessment.
However, as this approach grossly exaggerates realistic aggregate exposure, a more realistic
and refined risk assessment should be used for aggregate exposures where data allow and
there is a need for further refinement. With good data on habits and practices of cosmetic
product use and distributions of concentration use data in products, a probabilistic approach
to estimating exposure can be performed and so where data exist, further refinements of the

risk assessment can be performed. A consistent approach to describing a tiered exposure
assessment for cosmetics safety evaluation was proposed in Alexander-White et al. 2022
(Figure 3).

Figure 3: A tiered approach to exposure evaluation (Tier 1 deterministic; Tier 2 probabilistic)
for scenarios as indicated relating to the safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients
(reproduced from Alexander-White et al. 2022). The values generated as output from the
different tiers can be used in the safety evaluation. Values can also be taken into PBK
modelling approaches for further exposure refinement if useful.
For Hexyl Salicylate, separate exposure assessments are performed in this section for the
dermal and oral, and inhalation routes. As can be seen, a Tier 1 deterministic approach with
maximum % use levels yields a favourable outcome and in this case of assessing the
aggregate exposure to Hexyl Salicylate (and the resulting systemic exposure to salicylic acid)
further Tier 2 modelling was not necessary to refine exposure. Refinement may be undertaken
if considering the use of Hexyl Salicylate in the context of combined exposure to salicylic acid
from multiple sources, but such evaluations are the subject of a separate exercise.

experience in g product per day, for 17 different cosmetic products, and as calculated in
mg/kg bw/day (see Table 4).
To estimate a systemic exposure dose (SED) following dermal exposure, the standard worst
case deterministic aggregate Tier 1 exposure assessment approach, as per the SCCS 11 th
revision of the Notes of Guidance, has been performed and is presented in Table 5, with the
addition of an 18th product type â hydroalcoholic fragrances. In this approach the exposures
for individual product types are calculated, but also aggregated in a worst-case assumption.
This exposure scenario assumes 100% occurrence of Hexyl Salicylate at the maximum use
concentrations in cosmetic products used simultaneously by an individual in a day, which is
highly unrealistic.
A conservative value of 13.4% (see section 3.2.2) is used for skin absorption of the dermally
applied substance from all products, which is likely to be an overestimate.

Values for the maximum % level of Hexyl Salicylate that are used in Europe, in each of the
standard 17 product types plus hydroalcoholic fragrances (non-spray), have been provided in
a recent analysis of use by the members of the âHexyl Salicylate Consortiumâ, and are used
to calculate the total systemic exposure to Hexyl Salicylate (in mg/kg/day) from each product
(see Table 5).
Hexyl Salicylate is also used as a fragrance ingredient in hydroalcoholic fragrances and
therefore, this is added into the calculation as an 18th product type in Table 5. The exposure
to product (Eproduct) value normalised by weight is calculated by including the respective
retention factor for each product type (SCCS, 2021).
A generic maximal (and conservative) value for skin penetration of Hexyl Salicylate of 13.4%
(see section 3.2.2) has been used for all products in these calculations where dermal
absorption needs to be factored in to calculate a SED. For lipstick and oral care products, a
worst-case value of 100% absorption is used for passage across the oral mucosa/incidental
ingestion. A SED via the dermal route was calculated for each product in mg/kg/day and also
an aggregate systemic exposure dose for the 18 products (see Table 5).
As the metabolism data suggests rapid and extensive metabolism to salicylic acid, 100%
metabolic conversion has been assumed, and after correction for molecular weight, an
aggregate SED as a salicylic acid equivalent has also been derived (Table 5).

4. 1 mole of Hexyl Salicylate (MW = 222 g/mole) is assumed to be 100% metabolised to 1 mole of salicylic acid (MW
= 138 g/mole), therefore a conversion factor can be applied to account for this, using % metabolised and using
relative molecular weight conversion this leads to the calculation of salicylic acid equivalents in mg/kg/day.

3.2.4.2. Calculation of Systemic Exposure Dose (SED) â inhalation route
Based on the vapour pressure of Hexyl Salicylate, inhalation exposure through excessive

performed for the sprayed fraction of finished products as below.

SCCS comment
To be consistent with the other Tables, it would be better to express the SEDinh in Âµg/kg/day.
The value of 0.886 for the airborne fraction is based on an experiment (Steiling et al., 2014)
that derives a worst case of 11.4% product available for dermal exposure. This is therefore
not a worst case for inhalation exposure, and in the absence of other data, 100% of the
applied amount should be assumed to be available for inhalation. In addition, the amount of
application taken by the Applicant was derived by Hall et al. (2007) for product under arms
use. For its calculations, the SCCS has used instead the P95 value for underarms and torso
use (7839/day, fig 4 from Hall et al., 2007). With this consideration, the resulting exposure
is 8.25 (5.12 eq SA) instead of 1.13 Âµg/kg/d.

SCCS comment
The use amount derived from Steiling et al., 2014 goes back to Bremmer et al., 2006, and is
a P75. Therefore, for propellant spray SCCS has used the P95 (9890 mg/day) of Loretz et al.,
2006 for daily use combined with a frequency of 1, which is more conservative than the P90
derived for French citizens (4900 mg/application). Both values do not represent the European
population but are the best proxies available. This results in an exposure value of 2.30 (1.43
eq SA) Âµg/kg/d for propellant spray. The amount for pump spray used by the Applicant
is close to a P50 derived from Loretz et al., 2006 (3740 mg/day). The SCCS has therefore
used the P95 from Loretz et al., 2006 for daily use (15620 mg/day) in combination with a
frequency of 1. This results in an exposure value of 0.061 Âµg/kg/d for pump spray.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Overall Exposure Assessment Conclusion from the Applicant:
A deterministic worst-case systemic exposure dose (SED) estimate from aggregated dermal
exposure modelling of Hexyl Salicylate in cosmetic products is 0.112 mg/kg/day (see table
5). Assuming this is converted 100% to salicylic acid (SA), 1 mole of Hexyl Salicylate (MW =
222 g/mole) is assumed to be metabolised to 1 mole of salicylic acid (MW = 138 g/mole),
therefore a conversion factor can be applied to account for this using relative molecular weight
conversion, leading to the calculation of salicylic acid equivalents in mg/kg/day: SED Hexyl
Salicylate x 100% metabolism x 138 (MW salicylic acid)/222(MW Hexyl Salicylate) = SED
salicylic acid equivalent). The SA equivalent systemic exposure dose is 0.069 mg SA/kg/day.
This value will be taken forward into the safety evaluation and compared with the POD for
salicylic acid.
It is not necessary to add the dermal aggregate outcome for Total SED to the SED values
from inhaled spray products, as on any one day, only one (spray or non-spray versions) of
the type of products in Table 5 will be used, not both simultaneously. Typically, the non-spray
version of a product leads to the higher dermal SED and secondary incidental inhalation
exposure is often much lower than dermal exposure.
SCCS comment
SCCS agrees that, for most of the products, except deodorant and hair styling products, the
non-spray products lead to an equivalent or much higher systemic exposure when compared
to the spray products. Therefore, for these dermally applied products, the non-spray products
will be considered in the MoS calculation.
For deodorant, dermal exposure (using the same application amount and frequency as for the
inhalation exposure calculation) is 12.3 Âµg/kg bw/d and aggregate (inhalation + dermal) is
20.59 Âµg/kg bw/d, which is equivalent to 12.80 Âµg/kg bw/d SA.
For hairspray (propellant formulation), Dermal exposure to hair spray (using the same
application amount and frequency as for the inhalation exposure calculation) is then 6.6 Âµg/kg
bw/d and aggregate (inhalation + dermal) is 8.94 Âµg/kg bw/d, which is equivalent to 5.56
Âµg/kg bw/d SA.

Exposure of children <3 years to Hexyl Salicylate in cosmetics products

Taken from the Applicant:
Due to the restriction of salicylic acid-containing cosmetic products for children below the age
of 3 years a specific risk assessment is presented here for the use of 0.1% use of Hexyl
Salicylate in cosmetic products for infants and children at the age of 0-3 years.
The exposure assessment is derived from data in 0-3 years old European infants and children
from the recent Cosmetics Europe study in European Infants & Children (0â3 years old),
Creme Report, 14t October 2022. Based on this, the following SED for the aggregate exposure
to all products (including toothpaste) for the age group 0-3 years is calculated:

SCCS comment
The Applicant did not provide any specific scenarios for children applying cosmetic products
on their skin (dermal exposure) and did not took the differences between age categories in
some exposure parameters (body weight, amount of the products applied, body surface, etc)
into consideration. As the concern for this Opinion is on ED, which may lead to some specific
effects in vulnerable populations, such as children, specific exposure calculations for children
(between 3 to 10 years old) would have been needed. Table A.7.2 in the SCCS Notes of
Guidance (SCCS/1644/22) provides examples of the different cosmetic product categories
that are generally used for children of different ages.

Table 11: Skin irritation studies in animals for Hexyl Salicylate

Moderate skin irritation was reported in an OECD Guideline 404 study available in the ECHA
registration dossier (RIFM, 1986). In this study, female rabbits were exposed to 50% and
100% Hexyl Salicylate in DEP for 4 hours under semi-occlusive conditions. At 50% Hexyl
Salicylate, the mean erythema and oedema scores were respectively 2.0 and 1.4. The
observed effects were fully reversible within 7 days. For the undiluted substance, the mean
scores for erythema and oedema over the 24-72 hour period were respectively 2.0 and 2.16.
In this case, it was reported that one rabbit showed remaining erythema and oedema after 7
days. Nevertheless, these effects concerned only one animal and no information was available
for 14 days, which is the normal observation period recommended by OECD Guideline 404.
Overall, the results of the study could not trigger a classification for skin irritation according
to the CLP criteria.

not a classifiable irritant.

potential at concentrations of 0.3%, 3%, or 30% in 3:1 diethyl phthalate: ethanol. Results
indicated Hexyl Salicylate was not an irritant of concern.
Skin Irritation & Corrosivity Conclusion from the Applicant:
Overall, Hexyl Salicylate shows some irritant reactions in animal models at concentrations of
25% and above and very low skin reactions in one human study at 30%, but it is not
considered to be an irritant of concern at the concentrations used in cosmetic products.

which is an OECD Guideline 405/EU Method B.5 GLP compliant study. Hexyl Salicylate was
applied undiluted to the eyes of 4 female SPF albino rabbits in a volume of 0.1ml. Slight to
well-defined signs of irritation were observed in the treated eyes at the 1, 24 and 48 hour
examination time-points. However, all effects were fully reversible and no signs of irritation
were observed after 72 hours. Under the conditions of this study, Hexyl Salicylate does not
induce irritation of the eyes following its application. Based on these results, it does not need
to be classified according to Regulation EC No. 1272/2008.
Eye Irritation Conclusion from the Applicant:
Undiluted Hexyl Salicylate is not an eye irritant in vivo and there is no risk of eye damage at
the maximum concentrations of Hexyl Salicylate used in cosmetic products.

Opinion on Hexyl Salicylate (CAS/EC No. 6259-76-3/228-408-6)
_________________________________________________________________________________

In silico, mechanistic and in vitro skin sensitisation (new approach method, NAM)
data
From the chemical structure of Hexyl Salicylate (see Figure 1a), it does not contain any
electrophilic protein reactive groups and mechanistically, from its parent structure, as
predicted in the OECD Toolbox v4.2, it is not expected to be a skin sensitiser.
As per the skin sensitisation adverse outcome pathway (OECD, 2014), the in vitro direct
peptide reactivity assay (DPRA), Keratinosens and the h-CLAT/U-Sens tests represent key
events 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The results were evaluated following the OECD Guideline No.
497: Defined Approaches on Skin Sensitisation (OECD, 2021). Based on the two out of three
âDefined Approachâ, Hexyl Salicylate is predicted in vitro to be a non-sensitiser (see Table 13).
Animal skin sensitisation study data
Local Lymph Node Assay: An OECD Guideline 429 murine (n=4 female CBA mice) LLNA
was performed on Hexyl Salicylate (using the vehicle 1:3 ethanol: diethylphthalate) to GLP
(Betts, 2006). A very low EC3 (0.18%; EC3 = effective concentration that induces a 3-fold
increase in local lymph node proliferative activity) was reported, indicating Hexyl Salicylate
to be a classifiable sensitiser in this assay. This is a surprising result for Hexyl Salicylate that
requires mechanistic interrogation. It is unlikely that an impurity has caused this strong
reaction, as Hexyl Salicylate had an analytical purity of 98.5%. The detailed results of this

LLNA show that the increase in stimulation index is not always dose-dependent which may
indicate that an additional mechanism may be involved. It is known (Maas 2016) that a
metabolite (1-hexanol) can be formed in situ in the skin via the action of esterases, and the
alcohol could go on to be oxidised further to 1-hexanal quite rapidly by skin alcohol
dehydrogenase enzymes. If the test substance was applied to the mouse ear and 1-hexanal
was formed but not effectively cleared, 1-hexanal could be the sensitising metabolite in this
assay. Another explanation proposed was that irritation, being a confounding factor in the
LLNA, may have led to false positive responses (Kolle et al., 2019). However, overall, there
is no apparent chemical or biological reason for the positive response.
Guinea-pig Maximisation Test: A Magnusson-Kligman Guinea-Pig Maximisation Test
(GPMT) according to OECD Guideline 406 was performed using a group of 10 albino Dunkin
Hartley guinea pigs weighing 440-554g. Induction consisted of intradermal injection followed
one week later by a 48h occluded patch. The six intradermal injections were made to a 2.4
cm clipped, shaved area in the dorsal shoulder region. There were two 0.1 ml injections of
1% Hexyl Salicylate in 0.01% DOBS/saline, two 0.1 ml injections of 1% Hexyl Salicylate in
50% Complete Freundâs Adjuvant, and two 0.1 ml injections of 50% Complete Freundâs
Adjuvant. Seven days later, the site was clipped and shaved, and induction was supplemented
topically with a 48h occluded patch with 40% Hexyl Salicylate in acetone over the shoulder
injection sites. Thirteen to fourteen days after application of the shoulder patch, the guinea
pigs were challenged on the clipped and shaved flank using an 8 mm diameter filter paper
patch saturated with 10% Hexyl Salicylate in acetone which was applied for 24 h under
occlusion. Reactions were assessed at 24 and 48 h after patch removal. Three additional
challenge applications with 10% Hexyl Salicylate in acetone were made at weekly intervals
on the contralateral flanks. No sensitisation reactions were observed under the conditions of
this study (RIFM, 1981).
Guinea-pig modified Draize test: Hexyl Salicylate was tested in guinea pigs using a
modified Draize sensitisation study procedure in n=10 inbred Hartley albino guinea pigs
initially weighing approximately 350 g each. Four intradermal injections were administered
with 0.1 ml of Hexyl Salicylate at 2.5 times the ICC (Injection Challenge Concentration =
0.1%) at four sites overlying the two axillary and the two inguinal lymph nodes. Fourteen
days later the animals were challenged with an intradermal injection in one flank and a topical
application in the other flank using 0.1 ml Hexyl Salicylate at 0.1% (ICC) and 5% (ACC),
respectively. A second challenge was conducted 7 days later. Sensitisation reactions were
observed after the second challenge (Sharp, 1978).
Sensitisation was also assessed during a photoallergy test using groups of five
Crl:IAF(HA)-hrBR outbred albino hairless guinea pigs. Topical induction was performed using
a 0.3 ml dose of 100% Hexyl Salicylate. Doses were applied on days 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 of the
induction phase. On day 22, topical challenge was performed with 50% Hexyl Salicylate in
3:1 diethyl phthalate (DEP): ethanol and 100% Hexyl Salicylate. Test sites were observed at
1 and 4 hours, and days 1, 2 and 3. No sensitisation was observed (RIFM, 2003).
Human data
Diagnostic patch test studies: In a multicenter study, 218 fragrance sensitive patients with
proven contact dermatitis were patch tested with various fragrance materials according to
internationally accepted criteria. No reactions were observed with 5% Hexyl Salicylate in
petrolatum (Larsen et al., 2002).
Human Maximisation Test (HMT): A human maximisation test according to the method of
Magnusson and Kligman (1969) was carried out with 3% Hexyl Salicylate in petrolatum on
22 adult volunteers. Application was under occlusion to the same site on the volar forearms
or backs for five alternate-day 48-h periods. Patch test sites were pre-treated for 24 h with
5% aqueous sodium lauryl sulphate under occlusion. Following a 10-day rest period, a

challenge patch was applied to a fresh site for 48 h under occlusion. The challenge sites were
pre-treated for 30 min with 2% aqueous SLS under occlusion on the left side of the back
whereas Hexyl Salicylate was applied without SLS on the right side. Reactions to challenge
were read at patch removal and 24 h after patch removal. No reactions were produced (RIFM
(Epstein), 1975).
Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT): A repeated insult patch test was conducted in 103
subjects (29 males and 74 females) to provide confirmatory evidence that Hexyl Salicylate is
not a skin sensitiser in humans. During the induction phase a 0.3 ml aliquot of 30% Hexyl
Salicylate in 3:1 DEP:EtOH was applied to Webril/adhesive patches (25 mm Hilltop_ Chamber
System) on the left side of the back of each subject. This represented a dose of 35,433
Î¼g/cm2. Patches remained in place and were kept dry for approximately 24 h and then
removed. A series of nine induction applications were completed over a period of three weeks.
A rest period of approximately 2 weeks followed the last induction. At the challenge phase,
patches were applied as in the induction phase and kept in place for 24 h, after which time
they were removed and the challenge sites were scored. The test sites were also scored at
48, 72 and 96 h post-patching. No sensitisation reactions were observed (RIFM (Harrison),
2004). The HRIPT NOEL was therefore 35,433 Î¼g/cm 2.
Hexyl Salicylate has been classified as a Category 4 substance (infrequent cause of contact
allergy in relation to level of exposure) with regard to its human skin sensitisation potential
(Basketter et al., 2014). This classification by authors of the study is based on an analysis of
human data adapted from a number of published references. Substances in Category 4 are
rarely important clinical allergens, because they require considerable/prolonged exposure to
higher dose levels to produce sensitisation, which even then is unlikely to exceed 0.01% of
the exposed population.
Conclusion from the Applicant:
The skin sensitisation potential of Hexyl Salicylate has been investigated extensively. All
studies in humans, which carry the greatest weight, have been consistently negative
indicating that Hexyl Salicylate is a rare sensitiser in humans, if any. NAM in silico and in vitro
data also support this conclusion. Two rodent assays show anomalous results for Hexyl
Salicylate, indicating that rodent ADME or mechanisms of action may be different to humans.
Taken from the RAC opinion
Conclusion:
With EC3 values =< 2% in the LLNA, Hexyl Salicylate fulfils criteria for classification Skin
Sens. 1A according to the CLP guidance. Regarding human data, the HRIPT cannot be used
for the purpose of classification due to its low reliability. Nevertheless, the maximisation assay
and both diagnostic studies were negative and were considered reliable.
There are several possible reasons for the absence of sensitising reactions in these studies:
â

The patch test for Hexyl Salicylate is not marketed. In fact, 46 fragrances are marketed
by Chemotechnique for patch testing, but Hexyl Salicylate is not part of the list. Hexyl
Salicylate was therefore only tested for prospecting purposes. This could explain why only
2 diagnostic studies with different concentrations of this substance have been published.
â Hexyl Salicylate is not included in the list of 26 sensitising fragrances for humans that
require labelling. Therefore, it would be difficult to determine whether Hexyl Salicylate is
responsible for contact dermatitis following exposure to a fragrance.
â Although this substance is widely used in perfumes, the concentrations used are low. In
leave-on products for face and body, the concentrations are between 0.02 and 0.03 %
and between 0.08 and 0.12 %, respectively. The highest concentrations are used in rinse________________________________________________________________________________________

off products, reaching 0.52 % in soaps and cleansers (Cosmetic Ingredient Review on
salicylic acid and salicylates (2018)). These concentrations are below the concentration
limits recommended by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA).
Therefore, the absence of sensitising reactions observed in humans could be due to primary
prevention related to these concentration limits, more than the absence of sensitising
properties.
Due to the significant discrepancies between positive animal data and negative human
studies, sub-categorisation does not seem appropriate according to the CLP-guidance.
With the positive results of the LLNA of good quality, Category 1A would be justified. However,
since data are not sufficient for sub-categorisation, RAC agrees with the DS that Hexyl
Salicylate should be classified Skin Sens. 1 â H317.
SCCS comment
The SCCS agrees with the Applicant and the RAC opinion that the available human, animal
and NAM data are contradictory. In a well-conducted LLNA, Hexyl Salicylate was positive at a
relatively low concentration, whereas the GPMT was negative. In silico data showed no protein
binding alerts, which was confirmed in the DPRA. In addition, the Keratinosens was negative,
whereas the h-CLAT and U-SENS were positive. If for example the 2o3 DA (two out of three
defined approach) was performed, according to OECD Guideline 497, Hexyl Salicylate would
have been considered as a non-sensitiser. Human evidence is limited, but the data available
is all negative. This was observed already in an earlier SCCS Opinion on fragrance allergens
(SCCS/1459/11) and no new evidence indicating that Hexyl Salicylate is a relevant skin
sensitiser in humans has emerged in literature.
Taking all the evidence together, the SCCS concludes that although Hexyl Salicylate is
classified as a skin sensitiser, based on clinical evidence, the risk of skin sensitisation in
humans from the use in cosmetic products can be considered negligible.

3.3.3 Acute toxicity
3.3.3.1 Acute oral toxicity
There is one study in animals (RIFM 1975; Lapczynski et al., 2007) covering the acute oral
toxicity of Hexyl Salicylate as summarised in Table 14.
Table 14: Acute oral toxicity studies for Hexyl Salicylate

The animals in this study were observed daily for a period of 14 days for any signs of systemic
toxicity.
3.3.3.2 Acute dermal toxicity
There is one study in animals (RIFM 1975; Lapczynski et al., 2007) covering the acute dermal
toxicity of Hexyl Salicylate as summarised in Table 15.

3.3.3.3 Acute inhalation toxicity
There are no acute inhalation toxicity data available in animals for Hexyl Salicylate. The use
of Hexyl Salicylate in consumer products for decades has revealed no adverse effects in the
lung. Hexyl Salicylate is not irritating to the skin and eye at the concentrations used in
cosmetic products and therefore, is not expected to be irritating or toxic to respiratory tract
and lung at the concentrations used in cosmetic products.

Acute Toxicity Conclusion from the Applicant:
Hexyl Salicylate is not acutely toxic via any route of exposure.

3.3.4 Repeated dose toxicity
No repeat dose toxicity data are available on Hexyl Salicylate. Given that Hexyl Salicylate
itself is not regarded as the main toxicant, but rather salicylic acid as the chief hydrolysis
product, for the purposes of performing a cosmetics safety assessment, this section discusses
the available repeat dose toxicity data and conclusions for the primary Hexyl Salicylate
metabolites salicylic acid and 1-hexanol (Belsito et al., 2007). All data for salicylic acid were
recently reviewed by the SCCS in its recent opinion (SCCS, 2018).
SCCS comment
As the SCCS recently published a new Opinion on salicylic acid, data on this metabolite are
not reported in this Opinion. Only data provided by the Applicant on 1-Hexanol are reported
in this Opinion.

3.3.4.1 Repeated dose sub-acute and sub-chronic oral / dermal / inhalation toxicity
1-Hexanol
â¢

Oral route

As summarised in the ECHA REACH dossier for 1-hexanol, a 13-week dietary study in rats
using hexan-1-ol reported a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 1127 mg/kg (study
reported as by Scientific Associates Inc., 1966). No adverse effects were noted at any of the
dose levels administered during the study. The results of this key study are supported by the
reliable (Klimisch score 2) 3-week feeding study in rats which reported a NOAEL of
approximately 1000 mg/kg bw/day (Moody and Reddy, 1978, 1982). In addition, a 13-week
study in dogs reported a NOAEL for 370 mg/kg bw/day for male dogs and 435 mg/kg bw/day
for female dogs (study reported as by Scientific Associates, 1966). Although this study had
some methodology discrepancies, it is still considered to be reliable (Klimisch score 2).
â¢

Dermal route

No data reported on 1-hexanol
â¢

Inhalation

There are no data for Hexyl Salicylate that were generated before March 2013. Reference to
the similar ingredient methyl salicylate is provided below.
Methyl salicylate
Gage (1970) reported a study on methyl salicylate in rats (n=4; average weight 200g) where
20 x 7 h exposures were administered at 120ppm in a saturated atmosphere of 700 mg/m 3.
The atmospheres were dynamic and passed through the exposure chamber. Haematological
parameters were measured and the following organs were taken for microscopical
examination after fixation in formol-corrosive: lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and adrenals;
and occasionally heart, jejunum, ileum, and thymus. No toxicity was reported and all organs
appeared normal at necropsy. This provides evidence for a NOEC for methyl salicylate of 700
mg/m3.
3.3.4.3 Chronic (> 12 months) toxicity
/
Conclusions from the Applicant on repeat dose toxicity studies:
As there are no pre-2013 repeat dose data on Hexyl Salicylate, evidence that can be used to
perform a cosmetics safety assessment has long been provided from data on its main
metabolites, salicylic acid and 1-hexanol, to which the body may be systemically exposed.
No significant concerns are presented for salicylic acid in terms of repeat dose endpoints as
summarised by the SCCS conclusion below. Similarly, there are no safety concerns regarding
the generation of a 1-hexanol metabolite.
SCCS comment
SCCS noticed there are no repeated dose toxicity studies available on Hexyl Salicylate and
will therefore rely on its main metabolite salicylic acid for the safety assessment.

3.3.5 Reproductive toxicity
No reproductive/developmental toxicity data are available on Hexyl Salicylate. The proposal
for classification is based upon read across to salicylic acid and methyl salicylate data, and
the assumption that Hexyl Salicylate is metabolised to the same common metabolite, salicylic
acid.
Given that Hexyl Salicylate itself is not regarded as the main toxicant, but rather salicylic acid
as the chief hydrolysis product, for the purposes of performing a cosmetics safety assessment,
this section also discusses the available reproductive/developmental toxicity data and
conclusions for the primary metabolite salicylic acid and 1-hexanol to which the body may be
principally exposed.
SCCS comment
As the SCCS recently published a new Opinion on salicylic acid, data on this metabolite are
not reported in this Opinion. Only data provided by the Applicant on other analogues are
reported in this Opinion.

3.3.5.1 Reproductive and Developmental â oral
As the main premise for the safety evaluation (given there are no repeat dose toxicology data
for Hexyl Salicylate) is a confident analogue read across using data on the metabolite salicylic
acid, it is not necessary to rely on safety data for other structural analogues in this dossier.
However, for awareness and completeness, there is evidence on other simple alkyl salicylates
that can add to the confidence of the outcome from the safety evaluation performed in this
dossier.
Cyclohexyl Salicylate
An OECD Guideline 415 one-generation reproduction toxicity study was performed to GLP in
Wistar rats treated orally with Hexyl Salicylate (Schmidt, 1995). Dose levels were 60, 180
and 540 mg/kg bw/day in corn oil. Some general toxicity effects were seen in the F0
generation at the top dose, and a NOAEL could be determined at 180 mg/kg bw/day; this
dose had no effects on reproduction. In males a NOAEL was defined as 540 mg/kg bw/day.
With the F1-generation, a NOAEL of 180 mg/kg bw/day as effects on litter responses, survival,
growth and behaviour were seen at the top dose.
An embryotoxicity study (including teratogenicity) was performed to GLP (Pitterman, 1996).
Dose levels were 0, 40, 120 and 360 mg/kg bw/day, dosed daily in arachidis oil from day 6

to 15 of gestation. A standard dose volume of 5ml/kg bw was used. Each group was n=24
female rats. There were no effects of treatment seen in dams and there were no embryotoxic
or teratogenic effects seen up to 360 mg/kg/day.
SCCS comments
Full reports of these 2 studies on cyclohexyl salicylate have not been provided to the SCCS
and only limited information is available on the ECHA website.
Methyl salicylate
An SCCS Opinion was published for methyl salicylate in 2021 (SCCS, 2021). The pivotal study
that can be used to derive a point of departure (POD) for reproductive and development
toxicity is that from a 3-generation study by Collins et al. (1971), where the derived POD is
75 mg/kg bw/day. This provides further assurance that the POD derived from salicylic acid
data is relevant to use in this safety evaluation, also for Hexyl Salicylate.
3.3.5.2 Reproductive and Developmental â dermal
/
Conclusions from the Applicant on reproduction and developmental toxicology
studies:
Salicylates do not affect fertility or reproduction. As there are no specific reproductive and
developmental data on Hexyl Salicylate from before March 2013, evidence is provided for
cosmetics safety assessment from data on its main metabolites, salicylic acid and 1-hexanol,
to which the body may be principally exposed. Since 1-hexanol is not classified for
reproductive toxicity, the focus is on the more relevant metabolite salicylic acid data.
SCCS comments
The SCCS agrees that salicylic acid is a developmental toxicant. Harmonised classification of
salicylic acid was recently published in Regulation 2018/1480 and is classified as Repr. 2
(H361d Suspected of damaging the unborn child). For MoS calculation, SCCS uses the
developmental NOAEL of 0.1% (75 mg/kg bw/day) derived from Tanaka et al. (1973a). The
developmental effects observed in this study are the most sensitive effects after repeated
exposure to salicylic acid. This is also in agreement with the previous SCCNFP Opinion (2002)
and is also supported by Tanaka et al. (1973b).â
In addition, due to the evidence for high (100%) oral bioavailability in humans, the oral NOAEL
of 75 mg/kg bw/day is defined as systemic NOAEL (NOAELsys) by SCCS for salicylic acid.
This POD for salicylic acid can act as a conservative surrogate POD for Hexyl Salicylate. On a
molar basis, 1 mole of Hexyl Salicylate is converted to 1 mole of salicylic acid. An assumption
is made that 100% of Hexyl Salicylate is metabolised to salicylic acid and 1-hexanol, and
salicylic acid is the driver of any observed Hexyl Salicylate toxicity. The salicylic acid NOAELsys
= 75 mg/kg bw/day. A salicylic acid equivalent SED can be calculated and compared with this
POD as per Table 16.
During the consultation, the SCCS was informed that in the context of REACH Regulation, a
decision on testing proposals (TPE) is ongoing for hexyl salicylate. The deadline for submission
is 23 February 2026.

3.3.6 Endocrine disrupting effects
Hexyl Salicylate has not been identified by the European Commission as a suspected
endocrine disruptor. However, its major metabolite is salicylic acid, which is on the
Commission List of suspected endocrine disruptors. There is no convincing evidence that
reproductive and developmental effects are caused by an endocrine mechanism of action: the
rationale for reaching this conclusion is provided below. SCCS has recently adopted an Opinion
on Salicylic acid (SCCS/1646/22, June 2023).
In December 2017, the Danish Centre on Endocrine Disrupters published a report (Hass et
al., 2018) in which it was evaluated that salicylic acid meets the WHO definition of an
endocrine disruptor (ED) from 2002. It was concluded that there was moderate evidence of
with an anti-androgenic mode of action which seemed plausibly linked to adverse effects as
inhibition of androgen response to hCG (Human chorionic gonadotrophin) stimulation in
humans and decreased testicular weight, decreased activity of testicular enzymes and
impairment of spermatogenesis in rats. It is the view of the SCCS that although the toxicology
evidence suggests salicylic acid is a developmental toxicant (observations are on skeletal
abnormalities), there is no definitive evidence that salicylic acid causes adverse health effects
in an intact organism directly as a result of an endocrine mechanism. Nor is an anti-androgenic
mode of action hypothetically linked to skeletal abnormalities. This connection between
mode/mechanism of action and observed adverse effect is a basic requirement for substances
falling within the Commissionâs ED criteria and the ECHA/EFSA Guidance for the identification
of endocrine disruptors in the context of Regulations (EU) No 528/2012 and (EC) No
1107/2009 and based upon the WHO IPCS 2002 Definition.
Level 1 and 2 evidence is available for evaluating salicylic acid within the OECD Endocrine
Disruption Framework. Salicylic acid has been tested in the US EPA Endocrine Screening
Program in a range of in vitro assays (Level 2) and there was no evidence of an endocrine
activity in the assays tested.
There are no in vivo assays with salicylic acid that explicitly investigated a potential endocrine
mode of action. However, as mentioned above, there is no evidence from the available data
of an adverse effect of salicylic acid as a result of an endocrine mechanism, e.g., there is no
adverse effect on fertility.
The evidence given the greatest weight in the Danish review for salicylic acid in drawing their
conclusions is from Level 4 data on read-across analogue aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA)

and are of questionable quality with limitations in the data as discussed below. There are no
level 5 studies.
Level 1 data: Existing Data and Non-Test Information
Chemical structure and physicochemical properties e.g. as per Table 1.
Level 2 data: In vitro assays providing data about selected endocrine
Mechanism(s)/pathways(s) (Mammalian and non-mammalian methods)
Salicylic acid has been tested (purity >90%) in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program
(EDSP) within the US EPA Tox21 programme.
https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/dsstoxdb/results?search=DTXSID7026368#invitrodbbioassays-toxcast-data
There was no activity seen in 18 oestrogen receptor assays, there was no activity in 9 thyroid
receptor assays, and it was not steroidogenic in 2 assays. Of the 15 androgen receptor assays,
only one was registered as positive above a cut-off value but this was a marginal and
inconclusive observation. There was no evidence that salicylic acid was endocrine active in
these systems.
Similarly, no in vitro assays were positive in the EDSP for the structurally related substance
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).
Level 3 data: In vivo assays providing data about selected endocrine
mechanism(s)/pathway(s)
No data
Level 4 studies (on a read-across analogue aspirin):
Study 1
In a developmental toxicity study (Gupta et al., 2003), 7 pregnant rats were given ASA by
oral (gavage) administration between days 6 to 17 after mating. At the highest dose (250
mg/kg bw/day) 2 fetuses from 2 litters were observed to have hypoplastic testes. There were
no hypoplastic testes in the control group. There were no other findings in that study
suggestive of an anti-androgenic mode of action (e.g. cryptorchidism or hypospadias). The
testes findings were accompanied by severe maternal and fetal toxicity at the same dose,
which strongly suggests an absence of a specific endocrine mode of action but rather an
adverse secondary impact by general toxicity.
Study 2
In another in vivo rat study (Kristensen et al., 2011) females were treated with ASA at doses
of 150, 200 or 250 mg/kg bw/day between gestation days 13-21. In Hass et al. (2018), it
was noted that reduced anogenital distance in male rats (a marker of impaired androgen
signalling) was seen. The SCCS notes that when corrected for bodyweight, no effect on
anogenital distance was apparent. This is significant because proper evaluation of changes in
this parameter requires correction for bodyweight. That study also showed reduced in vivo
production of testicular testosterone in all dose groups, with significance in the mid dose
group. There was however no dose-response for this effect and in view of the SCCS, it is
unlikely to be related to treatment. It is interesting to note that these data are not presented
in the main article but embedded in the supplementary materials. In that same study,
questionnaires were given to Danish and Finnish women to report on their analgesic use
during pregnancy. The authors discovered that in the Danish cohort, an association was found
between cryptorchidism and use of analgesics. The association was not found in the Finnish
cohort. The numbers of pregnancies evaluated were small, and several factors were not taken
into account, such as the familial occurrence of undescended testes and the association of

this finding with multiple gestation. In general, human data from observational
epidemiological studies based on questionnaires are susceptible to recall bias since selfreporting information may be incomplete or inaccurate (as the authors mentioned
themselves). The critical factor is the lack of robust exposure data which is needed to
strengthen the assumed association between cryptorchidism and use of analgesics. Another
confounding factor with respect to this study may be that humans are generally exposed to
measurable levels of salicylic acid via dietary sources such as fruits and vegetables; one study
even found that vegetarians not taking aspirin had urinary levels of salicylic acid higher than
the non-vegetarians (Lawrence et al., 2003).
Study 3
The suggested link between ASA and effects on spermatogenesis comes from a study
published in 1980, in which groups of 6 young (21-24 days of age) or adult (age not specified)
rats received 50 mg ASA/kg bw/day for 30 days (Didolkar et al., 1980). After treatment,
testes were weighed and subjected to analysis of the activity of certain enzymes and
histopathology. These assessments suggested a significant decrease in testicular weight in
the younger (but not in the older) animals, and reduced activity of testicular sorbitol
dehydrogenase and hyaluronidase. Fewer spermatids were also observed in the treated
groups. The results of this study need to be viewed with caution, since it was a low-powered
study (6 animals/group) and not thoroughly documented. If these effects were real, they do
not necessarily indicate an endocrine mode of action. Given the many other in vivo studies
available on ASA and methyl salicylate as summarised in the draft SCCS opinion on SA, none
shows any clear adverse effects relevant to an anti-androgenic mode of action (neither in
terms of development nor fertility), so it seems unlikely that SA is anti-androgenic in vivo.
The overall conclusion is therefore that there is insufficient data to show that SA causes
adverse effects arising from an ED mode of action. .
The appendices of Hass et al. (2018) also discuss the ability of SA to displace thyroid
hormones from plasma proteins. The report concludes that âno studies investigated endpoints
relevant for evaluation of adverse effects related to thyroid disruption were foundâ. It should
however be noted that the SCCS Opinion quotes historical carcinogenicity studies on ASA
performed in rats and mice, both of which were negative.
Conclusion from the Applicant:
On the basis of evidence available to date, there is no definitive data to show that salicylic
acid (and hence Hexyl Salicylate) causes adverse effects in an intact organism arising from
an endocrine mode of action.
SCCS comment
For the identification of endocrine disruptors in the context of Regulations (EU) No 528/2012
and (EC) No 1107/2009, and based upon the WHO IPCS 2002 Definition, a connection
between mode/mechanism of action and observed adverse effect is a basic requirement for
substances falling within the Commissionâs ED criteria and the ECHA/EFSA Guidance. There
is no evidence from the available in vivo data of an adverse effect of Hexyl Salicylate and
salicylic acid resulting from an endocrine mechanism, e.g., there is no adverse effect on
fertility. The available evidence is therefore not strong enough to conclude on an endocrine
effect linking a mode of action with an adverse outcome. In vitro data did not show any
estrogenic, nor any androgenic, thyroid or steroidogenic properties of Hexyl Salicylate and
salicylic acid.

The mutagenicity of the substance Hexyl Salicylate was studied with five mutant strains of
Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535, TA1537, TA98, TA100, and TA102). The investigations
were carried using the standard plate incorporation assay with and without liver homogenate
(S9) from Aroclor 1254 pre-treated male rats as metabolic activation system.
Hexyl Salicylate was dissolved in DMSO and tested in concentrations of 5 to 5000 Âµg per plate
in the presence and 15 to 5000 Âµg per plate in the absence of S9. In the presence of S9-mix
Hexyl Salicylate was bacteriotoxic towards the strain TA1537 at 500Âµg/plate, towards the
strains TA100 and TA102 at 1504 Âµg/plate and towards the strains TA98 and TA1535 at 5000
Î¼g/plate. In the absence of S9-mix Hexyl Salicylate was bacteriotoxic towards the strain
TA1537 at 500 Âµg/plate and towards the strains TA98, TA100, and TA102 at 500 Âµg/plate.
Precipitation of the test compound at the plates was observed at 1500 and 5000 Âµg/plate.
Sodium azide, 2-nitrofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, mytomycin C, and 2-aminoanthracene
served as positive controls to confirm the reversion properties and the specificity of the
bacterial strains as well as the efficacy of the metabolising system.
In the concentration range investigated, Hexyl Salicylate did not induce a significant increase
in the mutation frequency of the tester strains in the presence or absence of a metabolic
activation system.
In conclusion, these results indicate that Hexyl Salicylate under the experimental conditions
described, was not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98,
TA100, and TA102 in the presence and absence of a metabolizing system.

November 3, 2022

Hexyl Salicylate was tested for its potential to induce micronucleus formation in the in vitro
micronucleus test. Lymphocytes isolated from fresh whole human blood were used in the
study. In all treatments, the solvent used for the test item was dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).
Based on findings in the preliminary assessment of solubility, the test item was prepared in
DMSO at 50.00 mg/mL. The test item was then prepared in a dilution series, typically with a
1.5-fold dilution factor. Cells were cytokinesis blocked using cytochalasin B (cytoB). To enable
calculation of the Cytokinesis Block Proliferation Index (CBPI), in order to determine
cytotoxicity, at least 500 cells from appropriate cultures were scored. For the selected
concentrations, the micronucleus frequency was determined in 2000 binucleated cells per
concentration. The final concentration ranges analysed for micronuclei were: 3h +S9
treatment schedule 98.77 to 222.2 Î¼g/mL 3h -S9 treatment schedule 43.90 to 98.77 Î¼g/mL
continuous treatment schedule (24h -S9) 29.26 to 65.84 Î¼g/mL
The recommended maximum level of cytotoxicity (55 Â± 5%) was achieved in all treatment
schedules. At the highest concentration selected for analysis, the following levels of
cytotoxicity were observed: 3h +S9 treatment schedule 57.65% at 222.2 Î¼g/mL 3h -S9
treatment schedule 51.43% at 98.77 Î¼g/mL continuous treatment schedule (24h -S9)
54.08% at 65.84 Î¼g/mL. Upon addition of test item to the culture medium, a precipitate of
the test item was observed at a concentration of 222.2 Î¼g/mL and above in all treatment
schedules. At the end of the treatment period, precipitate was observed at a concentration of
333.3 Î¼g/mL and above in the 3h -S9 and continuous treatment schedules, and at a
concentration of 500.0 Î¼g/mL in the 3h +S9 treatment schedule. The observations of
precipitate did not affect the selection of dose levels for evaluation of micronucleus frequency.

_________________________________________________________________________________

For all treatment schedules, data for background micronucleus induction in the solvent
controls were consistent with the test facilityâs historical control databases (based on 95%
Poisson confidence limits) for human lymphocyte cells.
The number of micronuclei analysed from 2000 binucleated cells for each selected test item
dose was compared with that from the concurrent solvent control.
The concurrent positive controls produced statistically significant increases in micronuclei
compared with the concurrent negative controls. No statistically significant increases in
micronucleus formation in the test item-treated cultures were observed as a result of any of
the treatment schedules.
There were no concentration-related increases when evaluated with Cochran-Armitage trend
tests. All criteria for a negative result were met after expert evaluation of the data.
It was concluded that Hexyl Salicylate did not induce the formation of micronuclei (MN) in
human lymphocytes in the presence or absence of S9, under the test conditions used. The
criteria for a negative response, as defined in OECD 487 and in the Study Plan, were met.
SCCS comment
A precipitate was noted at final concentrations of 250.0, 500.0, 1000 and 2000 Î¼g/mL. The
SCCS agrees with conclusion of the study that Hexyl Salicylate did not induce the formation
of micronuclei in human lymphocytes in the presence or absence of S9, under the test
conditions used.
3.3.7.2 Mutagenicity / genotoxicity in vivo
/
Mutagenicity and Genotoxicity overall conclusion from the Applicant:
Hexyl Salicylate is not genotoxic or mutagenic in the OECD guideline in vitro assays
performed. The mutagenicity and genotoxicity data for salicylic acid were recently reviewed
by the SCCS (SCCS, 2018) and 1-hexanol is also not genotoxic or mutagenic (CIR, 2017).
There are no concerns in relation to these endpoints for Hexyl Salicylate.
Overall SCCS comment
SCCS agrees that Hexyl Salicylate was not genotoxic or mutagenic in the in vitro assays
performed.
During the consultation, SCCS has been informed that in the context of REACH Regulation, a
decision on compliance check (CCH) is ongoing for hexyl salicylate. The deadline for
submission is 22 April 2025.
A. Information required from all the registrants subject to Annex VIII of Reach
- In vitro gene mutation study in mammalian cells (Annex VIII, Section 8.4.3.; test method:
OECD TG 476 or TG 490).
An update of evaluation of the mutagenicity may be needed when this study will be available.

3.3.8 Carcinogenicity
There are no carcinogenicity studies for Hexyl Salicylate. However, given that there are no
genotoxicity/ mutagenicity concerns from in vitro assays with or without S9, and it is also
highly unlikely that the main metabolites salicylic acid and 1-hexanol may act as carcinogens,
then there are no known concerns to address for Hexyl Salicylate.
Conclusion from the Applicant:
Hexyl Salicylate is not expected to be a carcinogen in animals.
SCCS comment
After analysis of the available data, the SCCS considers that Hexyl Salicylate is not likely to
be a carcinogen.

3.3.9 Photo-induced toxicity
The photoirritation/photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on data and
ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectra, in vitro data and in vivo data as described below.
UV Spectra Analysis (RIFM (Sears), 2014):
The available UV/Vis spectra (OECD TG 101) for Hexyl Salicylate indicate significant
absorbance between 290â700 nm, with peak absorbance at 305 nm and returning to baseline
by 330 nm. The molar absorption coefficient for wavelengths between 290â700 nm is above
the benchmark of concern (1000 L â mol-1 â cm-1) for photoirritating effects.
In vitro 3T3 cells (RIFM (Harbell), 2002):
Hexyl Salicylate was tested in the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) Photoirritation Assay.
Duplicate 96-well monolayers of 3T3 fibroblast were exposed to dilutions of test material (up
to 100 Î¼g/mL); 1 plate was exposed to 5 J/cm2 UVA irradiation (photoirritation), and the
other was not exposed to UV irradiation (cytotoxicity). The treatment medium was then
replaced by a culture medium, and, at approximately 24 hours after treatment, the number
of viable cells was determined by NRU. The number of viable cells present for each
concentration of test material was compared to that of untreated controls, and the percent
inhibition of growth was calculated. The IC50 concentration (i.e., the concentration producing
50% inhibition of growth) was calculated and expressed as Î¼g/mL for both the photoirritation
and cytotoxicity plates. A photoirritancy factor was then calculated by comparing the IC50
value obtained with and without UVA exposure. The results indicate that Hexyl Salicylate does
not have a photoirritating potential. No photoirritating responses were observed.
Mouse study (RIFM (Urbach), 1975):
Undiluted Hexyl Salicylate (20 Î¼l) was applied to a 2cm2 area of the back in n=6 Skh:hairless1 mutant mice exposed to light from a long arc xenon lamp and fluorescent blacklight lamps.
Six mice were used as a positive control group using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) in methanol
(0.01% w/v). Treated animals were exposed to a 6-kW long arc xenon lamp (distances = 1
meter, intensity = 0.1667 W/m2) for 40 minutes and 4 fluorescent F40BL-type blacklight
lamps with exposure for 1 hour with an intensity of 3 W/m2. The irradiation area was defined
by a 1 cm diameter hole punched in an aluminium foil adhesive tape, and the tape masked
the skin surrounding the exposure area. Reactions were assessed at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96
hours. Phototoxic reactions were observed at the irradiated positive control sites. No reactions

were observed at either the irradiated or non-irradiated test material treated sites. Hexyl
Salicylate was not phototoxic.
Miniature pig study (RIFM (Urbach), 1975):
Phototoxicity was also not observed in two miniature swine tested with undiluted Hexyl
Salicylate (20 Î¼l), according to the same procedure as for mouse test described above.
Guinea-pig (RIFM (Learn), 2003):
Photoirritation of Hexyl Salicylate was evaluated in two groups of n=5 Crl:IAF (HA)-hrBR
outbred albino hairless guinea pigs. A 0.3-mL aliquot of Hexyl Salicylate at 0%, 5%, 10%,
50%, and 100% in 3:1 diethylphtalate (DEP):EtOH was topically administered using Hilltop
chamber patches (25-mm diameter) to the dorsal skin along the midline of each guinea pig
and occluded with a dental dam. Two hours later, the patches were removed, and the
application sites were gently wiped with disposable paper towels moistened with deionized
water. The animals were exposed to UV radiation using a 6.5-kW long arc xenon water-cooled
lamp with a filter used to attenuate mid-range ultraviolet radiation (UVB). A dose of about
2.25 instrumental MED was delivered for each exposure session (approximately 2.25 hours).
MED refers to a UVR dose adequate to elicit a barely perceptible response in human skin.
Clinical observations were made immediately, 1 and 4 hours, and 1, 2, and 3 days after test
material administration and UV exposure. Hexyl Salicylate did not cause skin changes
indicative of photoirritation.
Guinea-pig (RIFM (Learn) 2003):
Photoallergy was not observed in two groups of n=5 Crl:IAF (HA)-hrBR outbred albino hairless
guinea pigs exposed to Hexyl Salicylate (50% and 100%). A nuchal area of skin,
approximately 2.5 cm2, was defined by intradermal injections (0.1 mL/corner) with a
formulation of sterile water and Freundâs complete adjuvant (1:1 v/v) in each animal. This
skin area was then tape stripped 5 times. A 0.3-mL aliquot of Hexyl Salicylate in 3:1 DEP:EtOH
was applied to HilltopÂ® chamber patches (25-mm diameter) and then applied to the nuchal
area and occluded with a dental dam. After 2 hours, the patches were removed, and the
application sites were gently wiped with disposable paper towels moistened with reverse
osmosis membrane processed deionized water. The nuchal area of animals was exposed to
UVR for approximately 2.25 hours. The UVR source was a 6.5kw long arc xenon water-cooled
lamp with a filter used to attenuate mid-range ultraviolet radiation (UVB). Exposures were
monitored by a customised detector that records both intensity and UVR dose. A dose of about
2.25 instrumental MED was delivered for each exposure session. Procedures were repeated
once daily on days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of the induction phase. On day 22, using the induction
procedure, Hexyl Salicylate at 50% and 100% was topically applied to each animal. Animals
were exposed to UVR for 2.25 hours, 2 hours after patch application. The sites were scored 1
and 4 hours after dosage administration and/or UVR exposure. Minimal flaking was observed.
Based on the results from the study, Hexyl Salicylate was not considered a photoallergen.

3.3.10 Human data
Human studies (RIFM (Potrebka), 2004):
Photoirritation potential was studied in 56 subjects (41 females and 15 males) who were patch
tested with Hexyl Salicylate (0.3%, 3%, and 30% in 3:1 DEP:ethanol), followed by irradiation
of sites with UVA and UVB. The test materials or controls were applied to 25-mm HilltopÂ®
Chambers, which were applied to the back of each subject. Each subject received duplicate
patches of the 3 concentrations of test material, and of 3 controls (vehicle alone, saline, and
a blank (no test material patch)) which were placed on both sides of the spine. Patches

remained in place for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the patches on the left paraspinal region were
removed, and the skin sites were irradiated with 16 Joules/cm2 of UVA irradiation for 10
minutes. Then the sites were irradiated with 0.75 Minimal Erythema Doses (MED) UVB. A
150-Watt Berger Solar Ultraviolet Simulator was used as the ultraviolet radiation source in
the study. Patches were removed from the non-irradiated test sites on the right paraspinal
region after the UVA/UVB dosing was complete. The non-irradiated sites were used as controls
to assess the irritation potential of the test material. Reactions were assessed at 1, 24, 48,
and 72 hours following UVA and UVB irradiation. No reactions were observed.
Conclusion from the Applicant on Photo-induced toxicity:
Based on the available in vitro, in vivo and human data, Hexyl Salicylate is not phototoxic or
photoallergenic.

SAFETY EVALUATION (including calculation of the MoS)

There are no repeat dose toxicity data for Hexyl Salicylate to use in a cosmetic safety
assessment. However, given that Hexyl Salicylate itself is not regarded as the main toxicant,
but rather salicylic acid as the chief hydrolysis product via all routes of exposure, it is possible
to perform a cosmetic safety evaluation for Hexyl Salicylate using the study by Tanaka et al.
1973 (from the reproductive/developmental data shown in section 3.4.5) for its principal
primary metabolite, salicylic acid.
Salicylic acid was reviewed recently by the SCCS in its Opinion from December 2023. The
POD for salicylic acid was selected as a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 75
mg/kg/day based upon the most sensitive observations in orally dosed rats, of teratogenic
effects, in the Tanaka et al. 1973 study.
A value for skin penetration of 13.4% (mean (3.04 +1SD) x a correction factor of 3) has been
used in all calculations of systemic exposure dose for dermally applied products (see section
3.2.2).
â¢
MoS for adults
Based on the exposure information in section 3.2, the Margins of Safety for consumer
exposures to Hexyl Salicylate in 18 cosmetic products are shown in Table 16 below.
Table 16: Deterministic worst-case margin of safety calculations for the dermal and oral route
using maximum % use levels as defined by the European Cosmetics Industry. Values of SED
are calculated according to the SCCS 11th Notes of Guidance approach for calculating a worstcase aggregate exposure on the basis of deterministic additive methods. Hexyl Salicylate is
assumed to undergo 13.4% skin penetration for all product types (except oral care and lipstick
where 100% is assumed) in this assessment. 100% metabolic conversion to salicylic acid
equivalent has been assumed, as per Table 5. For deodorant and hair styling products,
systemic exposure dose via spray formulations are used for the MoS calculation.

MoS for children

The Applicant did not provide any specific scenarios for children applying cosmetic products
on their skin (dermal exposure), nor were the differences between age categories in some
exposure parameters (body weight, amount of the products applied, body surface, etc) taken
into consideration. As the concern for this Opinion is on ED, which may lead to some specific
effects in vulnerable populations, such as children, specific exposure calculations for children
(between 3 to 10 years old) would have been needed. Table A.7.2 in the SCCS Notes of
Guidance (SCCS/1644/22) provides examples of the different cosmetic product categories
that are generally used for children of different ages. However, the SCCS notices that in view
of the high MoS for adults, far above 100, the MoS will also be above 100 for children between
3 to 10, considering also the product categories used by children of these ages.

Opinion on Hexyl Salicylate (CAS/EC No. 6259-76-3/228-408-6)
_________________________________________________________________________________

3.5

DISCUSSION

Hexyl Salicylate (CAS/EC No. 6259-76-3/228-408-6) is the INCI name of âhexyl 2hydroxybenzoateâ, an ingredient with sweet, floral, and fruity odour used in formulations of
fragrances in multiple consumer goods including cosmetic, household cleaning products,
detergents, and air care products.
Hexyl Salicylate is not listed in the Annexes to the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009
and its use is not otherwise restricted in cosmetic products.
Physicochemical properties
Information on the analytical methods used for the determination of purity and impurities of
the test substance and their results should be provided in accordance with the SCCS Notes of
Guidance.

Exposure
Dermal/percutaneous absorption
A value of 13.4 % (3.04% + 1SD corrected for 24 hours) was calculated following a recent in
vitro study using human skin that meets the basic criteria for skin absorption in SCCS Notes
of Guidance (2021). This value will be used for the calculation of the MoS.
Toxicokinetics
Hexyl Salicylate, like methyl salicylate and benzyl salicylate, is expected to be rapidly and
completely absorbed and metabolised, in both gut and liver tissue by first-pass metabolism,
to salicylic acid and 1-hexanol following oral exposure in both rat and humans. With rapid
hydrolysis in the gut and liver, systemic exposure is primarily to salicylic acid and 1-hexanol,
which do not accumulate in the body, and are rapidly excreted.
Exposure by oral route
Based on the available data, the SCCS considers that an absorption value by oral route of
100% can be used in the risk assessment.
Exposure by inhalation
There are no data on the extent of Hexyl Salicylate absorption in the lung. Based on the high
log Po/w and low water solubility, it is expected that Hexyl Salicylate will be poorly absorbed
by the inhalation route. An assumption of 100% absorption can be used in the risk
assessment, which is therefore conservative.
Systemic Exposure
Separate exposure assessments were performed for the dermal, oral and inhalation routes.
As the deterministic approach - based on maximal concentrations used - yields a favourable
outcome, further exposure modelling was not necessary to refine exposure. This Tier 1
scenario is based on maximum concentrations of Hexyl Salicylate that are used in products
in Europe, in each of the standard 17 product types as included in an aggregate exposure
assessment (according to the SCCS Notes of Guidance 2021). These levels have been
provided in a recent use survey by the members of the âHexyl Salicylate consortiumâ, and are
used to calculate the total systemic exposure to benzyl salicylate (in mg/kg/day) from each

product for adults. In addition to the 17 cosmetic products usually considered, an 18th product
type â hydroalcoholic fragrances - was included in the scenario.
For most of the products, except deodorant and hair styling products, the non-spray products
lead to an equivalent or much higher systemic exposure when compared to the spray
products. Therefore, for the MoS calculation the most conservative SED have been used (ie.
spray formulations for deodorant and hair styling products).
For deodorant, dermal exposure (using the same application amount and frequency as for the
inhalation exposure calculation) is 12.3 Âµg/kg bw/d and aggregate (inhalation + dermal) is
20.59 Âµg/kg bw/d, which is equivalent to 12.80 Âµg/kg bw/d SA.
For hairspray (propellant formulation), Dermal exposure to hair spray (using the same
application amount and frequency as for the inhalation exposure calculation) is then 6.6 Âµg/kg
bw/d and aggregate (inhalation + dermal) is 8.94 Âµg/kg bw/d, which is equivalent to 5.56
Âµg/kg bw/d SA.

Toxicological Evaluation
Irritation and corrosivity
Hexyl Salicylate shows some irritant reactions in animal models at concentrations of 25% and
above and very low skin reactions in one human study at 30%, but it is not considered to be
an irritant of concern at the concentrations used in cosmetic products.
Undiluted Hexyl Salicylate is not an eye irritant in vivo and there is no risk of eye irritation
at the maximum concentrations of Hexyl Salicylate used in cosmetic products.
Skin sensitisation
Available human, animal and NAM data on Hexyl Salicylate are contradictory. In a wellconducted LLNA, Hexyl Salicylate was positive at a relatively low concentration, whereas the
GPMT was negative. In silico data showed no protein binding alerts, which was confirmed in
the DPRA. In addition, the Keratinosens was negative, whereas the h-CLAT and U-SENS were
positive. If, for example, the 2o3 DA (two out of three defined approach) was performed
according to OECD Guideline 497, Hexyl Salicylate would have been considered as a nonsensitiser. Human evidence is limited, but the data available is all negative. This was already
observed in an earlier SCCS Opinion on fragrance allergens (SCCS/1459/11) and no new
evidence indicating that Hexyl Salicylate is a relevant skin sensitiser in humans has emerged
in literature.
Taking all the evidence together, the SCCS concludes that although Hexyl Salicylate is
classified as a skin sensitiser, based on clinical evidence, the risk of skin sensitisation in
humans from the use in cosmetic products can be considered negligible.
Acute toxicity
Hexyl Salicylate is not acutely toxic via any route of exposure.
Repeated dose toxicity
No repeat dose toxicity data are available on Hexyl Salicylate. Given that Hexyl Salicylate
itself is not regarded as the main toxicant, but rather its chief hydrolysis product, salicylic
acid, the available repeat dose toxicity data and conclusions for the primary Hexyl Salicylate
________________________________________________________________________________________

metabolites salicylic acid and 1-hexanol were reviewed for the purposes of performing a
cosmetics safety assessment. All data for salicylic acid were also recently reviewed by the
SCCS in its recent Opinion (SCCS, 2018).
Reproductive toxicity
No reproductive/developmental toxicity data are available on Hexyl Salicylate. The proposal
for classification is based upon read across to salicylic acid and methyl salicylate data, and
the assumption that Hexyl Salicylate is metabolised to the same common metabolite, salicylic
acid.
Given that Hexyl Salicylate itself is not regarded as the main toxicant, but rather salicylic acid
as the chief hydrolysis product, available reproductive/developmental toxicity data and
conclusions for the primary metabolite salicylic acid and 1-hexanol to which the body may be
principally exposed were reviewed for the purposes of performing a cosmetics safety
assessment.
SCCS considers that salicylic acid is a developmental toxicant. Harmonised classification of
salicylic acid was recently published in Regulation 2018/1480 and is classified as Repr. 2
(H361d Suspected of damaging the unborn child). For MoS calculation, SCCS uses the
developmental NOAEL of 0.1% (75 mg/kg bw/day) derived from Tanaka et al. (1973a).
In addition, due to the evidence for high (100%) oral bioavailability in humans, the oral NOAEL
of 75 mg/kg bw/day is defined as systemic NOAEL (NOAELsys) by SCCS for salicylic acid.
This POD for salicylic acid can act as a conservative surrogate POD for Hexyl Salicylate. On a
molar basis, 1 mole of Hexyl Salicylate is converted to 1 mole of salicylic acid. An assumption
is made that 100% of Hexyl Salicylate is metabolised to salicylic acid and 1-hexanol, and
salicylic acid is the driver of any observed Hexyl Salicylate toxicity. The salicylic acid NOAELsys
= 75 mg/kg bw/day. A salicylic acid equivalent SED can be calculated and compared with this
POD.
Mutagenicity / genotoxicity
SCCS concludes that Hexyl Salicylate was not genotoxic or mutagenic in the vitro assays
performed.
Carcinogenicity
After analysis of the available data, the SCCS considers that Hexyl Salicylate is not likely to
be a carcinogen.
Photo-induced toxicity
Based on the available in vitro, in vivo and human data, Hexyl Salicylate is not phototoxic or
photoallergenic.
Special investigation: endocrine disrupting effects
For the identification of endocrine disruptors in the context of Regulations (EU) No 528/2012
and (EC) No 1107/2009 and based upon the WHO IPCS 2002 Definition, a connection between
mode/mechanism of action and observed adverse effect must be demonstrated for substances
falling within the Commissionâs ED criteria and the ECHA/EFSA Guidance. There is no evidence
from the available in vivo data of an adverse effect of Hexyl Salicylate and salicylic acid as a
result of an endocrine mechanism, e.g., there is no adverse effect on fertility. The available
evidence is not strong enough to conclude on an endocrine effect linking a mode of action

with an adverse outcome. In vitro data did not show any estrogenic effects, nor any
androgenic, thyroid or steroidogenic properties of Hexyl Salicylate and salicylic acid.

4. CONCLUSION
1.
In light of the data provided and taking under consideration the CMR Cat.2 classification
(to be introduced in Annex VI to Reg. 1272/2008), does the SCCS consider Hexyl Salicylate
safe when used up to the maximum concentrations provided in the dossier?
Based on the assessment of data provided and taking into consideration the concerns related
to potential endocrine disrupting properties, the SCCS considers Hexyl Salicylate safe when
used up to the maximum concentrations as provided in Table 1 of this Opinion.

2.
Does the SCCS have any further scientific concerns with regard to the use of Hexyl
Salicylate in cosmetic products?
The Applicant did not provide any specific scenarios for children applying cosmetic products
on their skin (dermal exposure), nor were the differences between age categories in some
exposure parameters (body weight, amount of the products applied, body surface, etc) taken
into consideration. However, the SCCS notices that in view of the high MoS for adults, far
above 100, the MoS will also be above 100 for children between 3 to 10, considering also the
products categories used by children of these ages.
The SCCS mandates do not address environmental aspects. Therefore, this assessment did
not cover the safety of Hexyl Salicylate for the environment.
